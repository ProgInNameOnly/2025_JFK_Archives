FYI...

1, The Warren Commission's Report on the assassination of
President Kennedy focused attention on the magnitude of the problem.
involved in the protection of the Chief Executive. As you know, it is
our responsibility, overseas and in headquarters, to render every
support possible to the Secret Service in the conduct of its statutory
responsibilities in the United States, and especially when the President
travels abroad.

2. The circumstances confronting the Warren Commission
produced discussion and testimony on various aspects of the problem
of Presidential protection and on interagency operational cooperation,
which normally do not find their way into the public domain. These
include the acquisition and dissemination of information, consultation,
coordination, and operational interchanges, I believe you will be
interested in the attached extracts of testimony given before the Warren
Commission by U.S. intelligence and security officials. Pertinent
Fortions have been side lined. I commend these materials for reading
by all officers in positions of senior responsibility in headquarters and
overseas,

Dear. Anthony,
Re arding your letter 6/705 of 10 May 1982, our

records indicate~that Valeriy Viadimirovich Kostikoy

traveled to Mexico, France, Spain, the U.S. and Cuba

during the period 1959-61. In 1961, he was assigned

permanently to Mexico City as a consular officer and

served there until August 1965. He was varigusly

described as a translator, vice-consul, and attache.

During this tour he attempted to cultivate a U.S.

Government employee assigned to our embassy in Mexico

City. do
Rolr- - ‘

In September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald
approached ‘the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt
to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR.
Kostikov, as a consular officer, handled this visa
request. We have no information which indicates ‘any
relationship between these individuals other than for the
purpose of Oswald's making his visa request.

Kostikov returned to Mexico City for a second tour of
duty in July 1968. During this tour he was again assigned
to the consular section and was a second secretary. It
appeared that he was tasked with following the activities
of the Central American communist parties.and left-wing
groups, and he met often with members of” these groups,
reportedly providing them with funds and technical
guidance. In July/August 1969, Kostikov made an unusual
TDY trip to Moscow lasting three weeks. (His family
remained in Mexico.) In July 1970 he made a four-day trip
to Havana.

Kostikov's tour in Mexico ended unexpectedly in
September 1971, Our information indicated that he was
not due to leave for another three to four months, and at
the time of his departure, there was some speculation that
the suddenness of his departure was due to the fact that = os

he was known to Lyalin. too - Bo eS

While in Mexico he was considered by some to be the
mont effective and dangerous of intelligence officers in
Mexico. He has been described as being without morals,
education, and manners. | Shortly after his arrival in
Mexico in 1968, he was arrested in front of a house of
prostitution after becoming involved in a fist fight with
some locals. It appears this incident did not affect his
position in Mexico City, despite the fact that it
received a good deal of press coverage.

We are aware only that Kostikov arrived in Beirut in
June 1978. We are unable to confirm his presence there
now.

Although our file indicates that Kostikev may have
been a member of Department 13 (Executive Action)
(Department V's predecessor), we have been unable to
confirm this. Also, to the best of our knowledge the KGB
has not engaged in such executive action since 1959.

Sincerely,

VALERIY VLADIMIROVICH KOSTIKOV— .

1. Please refer to our conversation of 6 May. KOSTIKOV, born 17 March
1933, Moscow, was posted to Beirut in 1978 as lst Secretary and may still
be there. He is identified KGB and served in Mexico City from 1961-71.
There is a reference to him on page 307 of BARRON's KGB which suggests

that he may have been Department V. We do not appear to have asked LYALIN
about him, and are now doing so.

2. We also note that EPSTEIN in "Legend" claims that accerding to a CIA
telecheck KOSTIKOV was Lee Harvey OSWALD's KGB case officer in Mexico City.
According to BARRON (page 335) OSWALD was in Mexico between September and
November 1963 and was seeking to obtain a Soviet visa. There was certainly
a KGB interest in OSWALD, although according to NOSENKO this was defensive.

3. The reason for our current interest in KOSTIKOV will be obvious. As

you are aware, our Embassy in Beirut, in common with other Western Missions,
has been subject » threats and violence in recent months, and in view of
earlier hostile attentions from the KGB, we have been reviewing our records
of KGB staff in the area who might have been involved in promoting strong-arm
tactics,

4. We would be grateful for your views as to whether the KGB are likely to
be behind any of the recent incidents (possibly through the Syrians) and for
any information on KOSTIKOV and his activities in Mexico and in Beirut. In
particular, what are your comments on the OSWALD story; can you confirm that
KOSTIKOV is still in Beirut; is there anyone else in Beirut or Damascus whose .
trace record suggests an Active Measures role, or worse?

5. We should be grateful for an early reply and as I said on 6 May will treat
anything you can tell us on a strictly Service to Service basis.

Warren Commission Report:
District Attorney Garrison
> REFERENCES

1. We are forwarding herewith a reprint of the article “A Reporter At Large:
Garrison", published in THE NEW YORKER, 13 July, 1968. It was written by ~
Edward Jay Epstein, himself author of a book, ("Inquest"), critical of the
Warren Commission Report.

2. The wide-spread campaign of adverse criticism of the U.S., most recently .
again provoked by the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy, appears to have
revived foreign interest in the assassination of his brother, the late President
Kennedy, too. The forthcoming trial of Sirhan, accused of the murder of Senator
Kennedy, can be expected to cause a new wave of criticism and suspicion. against.
the United’ States, claiming once more the existence of a sinister "political
murder conspiracy". We are sending you the attached article--based either on
first-hand observation by the author or on other, identified sources=-since it
deals with the continuing investigation, conducted by District Attorney Garrison

: of New Orleans, La. That investigation | tends to keep alive speculations ebout the
death of President Kennedy, an alleged "conspiracy", and about the possible
involvement of Federal agencies, notably the FBI and CIA. .

3. The article is not meant for reprinting in any media. It is forwarded
primarily for your information and for the information of all Station personnel
concerned. If the Garrison investigation should be cited in your area in the
context of renewed anti-U.S. attacks, you_may use the article to brief interested.
contacts, especially government and other political leaders, and to demonstrate to
assets (which you may assign to counter such attacks) that there is no hard -- .
evidence of any such conspiracy. In this context, assets may have to explain to

_ their audiences certain basic facts about the U.S. judicial system, its separation

of state and federal courts and the fact that judges and district attorneys in the
states are usually elected, not appointed: consequently, D.A. Garrison can continue
in office as long as his constituents re-elect him. Even if your assets have to
discuss this in order to refute--or at least weaken--anti-U.S. propaganda of ©

sufficiently serious act, any personal attacks upon Garrison (or any other- “public
personality in the U.S.) must be strictly avoided.

CAPABLE BUT GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS AN IDEQLOGICAL
HARDLINER. THE PROFESSOR BELIEVED THAT HE WAS LIKELY TO BE A
RISING STAR IN THE SOVIET SYSTEM AND RECOMMENDED HIM FOR AN

. IREX-SPONSORED VISIT TO THE U.S. AS EXPECTED, NIKONOV'S VIEWS
AND RHETORIC MODERATED VERY VISIBLY AFTER HIS FIRST OIRECT
EXPOSURE TO ?HE U.S. HE HAS HAD AT LEAST ONE ADDITIONAL
IREX-SPONSOREO TRIP TO THE U.S. AND HAS SPENT PERIOOS OF TIME
As A FERSONAL GUEST AT THE HOME OF THE U.S. PROFESSOR IN

ARYLAND.

NIKONOV SAID HIS FRIENDS WERE DELIGHTED THAT HE HAD DECLINED
THE KGB COMMISSION.

OETERMINE IF LEE HARVEY ((OSWALD)) HAO BEEN A KGB AGENT. HE
REVIEWED FIVE THICK VOLUMES OF FILES GN OSWALD. NIKONCY 1S GW
CONFIOENT THAT ZSWALO WAS AT NO TIME AN AGENT CONTROLLED BY THE
KGB. FROM THE GESCRIPTION OF OSWALO IN THE FILES HE douBT EC
THAT ANYONE COULD CONTROL OSWALD, BUT NOTED THAT THE

SOVIET WIFE, WHG RODE HIM iNCESSANTLY. THE Flic ALSO REFLECTES
THAT OSW8.0 WAS A POCR SHOT WHEN HE TRIEO TARGET FIRING IN THE
USSR,

6. IN PREPARATICN FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A LIAISON
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SWEDISH INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, NIKONOV
PERSONALLY PERFORMED AN INQUIRY FOR BAKATIN INTO THE FATE OF
SWEDISH DIPLOMAT RAOUL ((WALLENSERG)). THERE I$ STILL PRESSURE
FROM THE SWEDISH SIOE TO HAVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER ON THIS
MATTER BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING IMPORTANCE OF THE WALLENBERG
FAMILY. NIKONOV WAS AMAZEO TO FIND OUT THAT THE KG3 HAD NOT
,BEEN ABLE TO PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISH WHETHER WALLENBECRG HAD DIED

“AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. HE WAS ABLE TO FIND PARTIAL

EVIDENCE FROM FOURTEEN OIFFERENT SOURCES (NF:). NIXONOV NOW
BELIEVES, BUT FOUND NO CONCLUSIVE PROOF, THAT WALLENBERG WAS
EXECUTED LATE IN 1947. THERE WERE INCICATIONS THAT WALLENBERS
WAS SUSPECTEC OF HAVING CONTACTS WITH OTHERS WHO WERE ACCUSED
OF PROVIDING FALSE OIPLOMATIC IDENTITY DOCUMENTS TO OTHERS
BEYOND JEWS SAVEO FROM THE HOLOCAUST. . AMONG THESE WERE NAZI
WAR CRIMINALS WHO WERE ALLOWED TO ESCAPE. THERE WAS NO PROCF
OF WALLENBERG'S GUILT IN ANY OF THESE CHARGES.

suyject: THE LEE HARVEY OSWALD CASE #351164

. 1. According to a newspaper column of "Allen and Scott" in the

’ Chicago American of 6 December 1963, on the OSWALD Case, Abram CHAYES,
legal Officer of the State Department, was one of two persons in-
mediately responsible for OSWATLD's being permitted to return to the
United States from the Soviet Union in June 1952. The other individual i
named was Iiewellyn THOMPSON, the then Ambassador to Russia. Another in
said to have been involved in.the handling of OSWALD's case was Samuel
WISE, Counsel of the American Embassy in Moscow.

2. Abram CHAYES, #735223h, who as of 16 February 1961 was deserined
(2) as “the new Counsel in State" » was grented Security approval for lielgor
‘contact with J. Foster COLLINS (in the office of the Chief of the Cover
Action Staff) on 6 March 1961. The request for CHAYES' clearance was a
"Blanket" request to permit. discussion with him of NSC 5412/2 metters cn.
a need-to-know basis. .

3. In September 1961 there was a White House namecheck request on
CHAYES' wife Antonia (toni) Leigh CHAYES, nee: HANDLER. .

contact clearance with C/CA on a continuing basis. This time his contact

1
|
4, In March 1962, CHAYES was granted a renewal of his liaison |
was Archibeld ROOSEVELT, Jr.

5. On 10 February 1962, HUMAN EVENTS reported as follows with
reference to CHAYES: ; .

Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, has
scored the new State Deoartment regulations on passports, clain-
ing they would allow Reds denied passports to "rifle freely the °
confidential. files of the FBI, the CIA and other investigative 7
agencies." The man behind the new regulations, which Walter ts
claims violate the Internal Security Act of 1950, is reportedly :
State's chief legal officer, Abram Chayes. Chayes, a Kennedy ;
appointee, is an ex-Harvard professor who was Chester Bowles’
top legal.adviser when Bowles was Governor of Connecticut. :

regulations." Oar 2 ofo. :

6. Samuel WISE, "Counsel in the American Embassy in Moscow" who
is referred to above, may well be Samuel Griffin WISE Jr., #74574,
SD & SSD, who apparently was once a contract employee on AEACTIVE.
[fhe State Department reviewed WISE's file on 2 June 195k; and as of
September 1962 a Samuel G. WISE was Second Secretary of the American
Embassy in Moscow. At that time WISE advised in a cable to the State
Department _ . . re te wp ene J

’DAVIS' case is very similar to that of.

. OSWALD; and he, like OSWALD, Lived in the Soviet Union for two years

after his defection and prior to making application for return to the
United States .7 .

7. WISH was an applicant for CIA employment in early 1953 and
was security approved subject to polygraph on 11 August 1953. He did
not enter on duty and in September 1953 the office which had been
interested in him was "no longer interested". On 13 November 1953,
WISE was granted a CSA.to permit his use as a contract employee on
AFACTIVE in. New York City. His CSA was cancelled on 24 March 1958.

8. WISE was named as a friend of William Orville MUNSELL, #61693-DL,
auring an investigation of the latter for possible CIA employment in 1952.
WISE, according to MUNSELL's landlady and social acquaintance in Washington,
D.C. during the pericd of about a year which ended. in April 1952, was the
only person she knew by name with whom MUNSELL was friendly. According
to the informant, WISE was a student at Columbia University whose address
was 423 Fornald Hall. MUNSELL was Security disapproved for CIA employment
in June 1952 because of his close association on a professional and social
basis, while attending Denver University from 1946 to 1951, with persons
of questionable loyality. In November 1954, MUNSELL was of interest to
project FIALIVE with reference to assignment to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia;
however, the interested office withdrew their request on him, after
Security advised of the derogatory information regarding him.

9. WISE from 1951 to 1954 attended Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale,
New York, which was attacked by a Citizen's Group, which alleged Communist
influence in the school system. He had several questionable associates in
addition to MUNSELL.:

‘daughter of'a former Haitian Ambaesador to Belgium, aad she is a devout
Episcopalian. The couple is known to have three children: a son who was

German birth who waa employed in the Castro land-reform organization |

‘uatil his departure for Germany in December 1961; and a son, Aatonio

RODRIGUEZ Jones, born 24 August 1943 at Havana, who was studying at
the Ecole francaise Internationale in Washington, D.C. in 1961. This son
has been reported to be anti-U.5. and to have requested permission of his
father to go to Cuba or te another "socialist country to continue his

~ Mise JONES was bora 10 April 1910 at Antwerp, ‘Belgium; she was unmarri:

and was a secretary at the Pan Americaa Health Organization. She became
a U.S. citinen in 1959, Since the Castro regime has come to power,

‘Mies JONES is said to, have opoken quite opealy for Castro and againet the

U.S. Government.

_ RODRIGUEZ lived in Haiti for about éighteen years prior tothe =~
commencement of his diplomatic career, having been barred by the Batist:
government from returning to Cuba. He became a Haitian citizen and was
the owner of a Port-au-Prince meat market called "Z] Oso Blanco". Wher
Castro aseumed power in Cuba, RODRIGUEZ took over the Cuban Embassy
in Port-au-Prince in January 1959 alter the Batista-appolated officials had
fled to the Dominican Republic. Soon thereaiter he was named Ambassado:
to Haiti. ee

In late July 1959, Haiti was invaded by a small gr ap of Cubans, suppos
as a prelude to an invasion of the neighboring Dominican Republic. The
incursion was succesefully repelled by the Haitian Government, which
publicly charged RODRIGUEZ with complicity in the raid. RODRIGUEZ the:
closed the Cuban Embassy and returned to Cuba after selling hie private
property in Haiti.

While RODRIGUEZ was atill in Haiti, two attempts were made on his
life. He-accused the Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic aad,
indirectly, the Haitian Goverar:ent of complicity in those attacks.

L

Ta November 1959,. RODRIGUEZ went to Guatemala as Cuban Ambassadc:
There, he appears to have associated freely with pro-Commuaist groups. J.
March 1960, he was requested by the Guatemalan Goverament to leave the
country on the ground that he was engaging in activities inimical to the best
interests of Guatemala.

In November 1960, RODRIGUEZ reported to Karachi,. Pakistan, as Cubs.
Ambassador. His wife accompanied him there and served as his chief .
secretary. During the initial months of hie tour there, hie closest relation.
in the diplomatic colony were with officials of the Belgian Embassy,

. presumably as a result of ithe fact. that: Belgium. had represented Cuba when
/there was no. Cuban repres ative in Karachi. During 1961, however, his
‘social contacts were almos exclusively with Sovi atellite and Chinese

. ‘Commualst diplomatic. pe: 60 - ee

In late 1961, ‘when RODRIGUEZ apparently had decided t to defect, he
confided to an acquaintance in the diplomatic colony that he was finished
“with politica and wanted to devote the rest of his life to agriculture. He he:
at the time to go to the Dominican Republic or to another, unspecified Sout!:
American nation. At the time of his departure from Karachi by alr for
Germany ia early 1962, RODRIGUEZ reportedly made only a very limited
statement at the airport regarding his defection. The event apparently
received very little, if any, prese notice in Pakistan.

: '. Insufficient information existe at present to permit a determiaation ae :
“the genuineness. of RODRIGUEZ's disaffection with the Castro regime. Fe:
- rensone which have not as yet been fully.reported, the Department of State
. dented a visa to RODRIGUEZ, apparently after he had made the decision tc
_resiga his post in Pakistan. “We understand, howevor, that, following his

. 1. INTRODUCTION. As a follow up to reference, Maj. Watlington
arrived in Wiami on 6 June 1962. After Maj. Watlington had an op-
portunity to discuss the local situation with Lt. Col. Carlos Causes +
the local ACSI representative, arrangements were made for a lengthy

| session on the subject of Agreed Activities. It tas agreed that

| this discussion would take place at 1000 hours on 7 June 1962 at a
JEWAVE safehouse facility. This meeting subsequently took place as

| . geheduled and was participated in by Lt. Col. Causes, Kaj. Watlington,
Dudley R. JENTONS, Charles B,.WIESINGER and Andrew K, REUTEMAN.
fhe specific points which were outlined in this discussion are
covered in the following paragraph.

|

|

2. DISCUSSIONS. in the course of the 7 June 1962, conversations
with ACSI representatives the following topics worthy of recording
were discussed.

a. Opa Locha Refugee Referral Procedures. Way.
Watlington made the point that in accordance with the
agrecrents which had been reached between ACSI and
KUBARX, local procedures were to be agreed upon in
order that ACSI might obtain refugee referrals froa
Gra Locka which could be used as a basis upon which to
mount OB collection operations. Maj. Watlington under—
scored the point that ACSI had no interest or charter
to run other than OB collection operations. At the — : |
Gane time if any of their operations produced intelli- 3 OF ‘a
Gence on subject matter other than OB, this intelligence ° ‘ i
on would be reported via existing ACSI reports channels,

. REUTELAN indicated that JLAVAVE, acknowledged the validity
of ACSI's mission in the OB field, and we were therefore
f ; willing to 99 erate fully in this regard. On the other ra
eg  yahds ve Lies S6ved that it was essential that certain +

safeguards bo built into any Opa Locka r@ferral in.order
that we could minimize the possibilities for duplication
“of effort and/or wire crossing. This concept was readily
accopted by Maj. Watlington. It did not, however, strike
a totally responsive chord in Lt. Col. Causes. This was
noted but in order to proceed with preliminary arrange-
nents, REUTENAN put forth the proposal that ACSI register
a list of dgent requirements with Opa Locka and that this
‘list could then be used as a basis upon which refugee
screenings could be conducted. It was suggested that Col.
Kail would be the logical point of reference in Opa Locka }
through which the referral system could be managed. In ame
. *this connection it was pointed out that once Col. Kail ~
identified an individual whom he considered tobe pri- —~
marily.of ACSI interest, he could arrange for this indi-
vidual to be referred to Lt. Col. Causes' covert unit,
At the same time Col. Kail would make arrangements to pass
to KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and to Station
JMWAVE ao copy of the Opa Locka debriefing of the individual
who had been referred to ACSI. Upon receipt of this in- :
formation KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and at
Station JMWAVE would review the referral, If this review
revealed that the individual was not of operational
ars, interest to JIMWAVE and his primary access was not in fields
. V7 other than OB, no objections would be expressed relative
to ACSI retention and full exploitation of the body. Maj.
Watlington expressed satisfaction with this proposal and
“gtated that he would be prepared to discuss it further
once he had an opportunity to personally review the func-
tioning of the Opa Locka _center. ~

as a bell with any of the JMWAVE representatives, Lt. Col.
Causes was asked for further details. This produced the
mtatement that ACSI was interested in CucSta ‘And wanted
to uso him in an infiltration operation: ACSI had allegedly
previously traced Cuesta with Station viWAVE and had re-
coivod the reply that’ KUBARK had been in touch with the
individual but had terminated him because he was unreliable.
, In view of this response Lt. Col. Causes wanted to know
whether we would recommend the reuse of Cuesta by ACSI.
Wo responded tea this by stating that we would review our
files and would forward a written reply to Lt. Col, Causes
within tho next few days. . . . sae

Lt. Col. Caugos stated that he felt that he had
established his equity in Ordonez through the name
trace procedure. Despite this, he had found that
Ordonez had disappeared from circulation; and, there-
fore, he assumed that we were debriefing this man.

e. Third Country Diplomats. REUTEMAN asked the
ACSI representatives whether they were currently in
touch with any third country diplomats. aj. Watlington
stated that\ACSI had previously tried to harness thepy
€apabilities of the Spanish, Uruguayan and Canadian §
@iplomatic pouches./{ Coordination of these activities
With KUBARK had resulted in ACSI's being denied the use
of these facilities. As a result Maj. Watlington stated
that at thy present time ACSI was not: in touch with any
third OF Bnet, On the other hand, ACSI was

interested in pursuing the third country diplomatic

channel ps a means of establishing communications with
inside dssets. At this point Lt. Col. Causes stated

that he was very disappointed at KUBARK's refusal to

allow him to use the facilities of the{Spanish, Uruguayan’2

or Canadian poucheS\] It was indicated that KUBARK under-

stood I. Col. Causes' reaction; however, the KUBARK
position was based on sound security principles and
could not be altered. The additional explanations which
were made relative to the security implications which
were inherent in the use of third country diplomats and
how misuse could affect long standing government to
governnent or service to service agreements between
ODYOKE and free worid countrics did not make any impact
on Lt. Gol. Causes. This gentleman was predisposed to
anterpret KUBARK's refusal to allow him to use certain

2 (diplomatic pouch Phanneis as a clear indication that
Sie-of KUBARK*s “primary responsibilities in the Hiani
area was to restrict and inhibit ACSI operational activity.
Once this attitude was identified no further attempts were
made to persuade Lt. Coi. Causes that our actions had
been taken in the best interests of the intelligence
community.

f£. Wardtime Yafiltvation of ACST fgents. A dis-
cussion of those Support Gervices which KUEARK might
render to ACSX operations revealed that Lt. Col. Causes
was still interested in having JMWAVE infiltrate two of
his agents into PRRUMEN, in this connection the poiut
was made by ACSY that under optimum circumstances they
would prefer that JMVAVE assume responsibility, for the
agents in. the lidami area and then deliver them through a
secure mechanigm to liavana. if this were not possible
ACSX would reluctantly accept infiltrativa of their agents
into any point in PBRUMEN. Lt. Col, Causes was told in
very precise terns that JMWAVE would not undertake to
infiltrate any of his agents into Havana, On the other
hand, we would consider any proposal for the infiltration
of selected agents to a beach area in PBRUMEN, The point
was made that in this connection Lt. Col. Causes had to
understand that our maritime capabilities were limited
and we were currently committed to the full exploitation
of ‘these assets for at least six weeks in advance. As a
result any operational plan which he might submit to us
should be keyed to the agsumption that approximately six
to eight ‘weeks would paGs before we could realistically
consider the servicing of his request. Lt. Col. Causes

agreed to project his operational plans within this frame
..of reference, “iF

problem relative to agent infiltrations revoaled that at
* the ponent - ACSI gid not have any.documentation problems
which they’ felt warranted discussion at this session, | ’
: h. " Coordinatioa Forms. The discussion of opsra-
tiopal coordination revealed that ACSI was willing for
JMWAVE to coordinate locally those operational. proposals
which might be received from,Lt. Col. Causes. Once this ;
coordination was effected and if there were disagreoment, ~
then the operation could be referred to the Washington L
headquarters of both ACSI and JIMWAVE, Maj. Watlington . >
stated that the forms for effecting coordination in ac-
cordance with procedures which had been agreed upon at
a4 Washington would be sent to both JMWAVE and the ACSI unit
vad in Miami in the near future. In view of this Maj. .
_ Watlington suggested that we not initiate the coordination
mechanism until these forms were on hand circa 1 July 1962.

i. W/T Assets. The discussion of the use of W/T
facilities in terms of PBRUMEN operations revealed that
the Miami ACSI unit did not have any W/T assets in
PBRUMEN at this time. On the other hand, Lt. Col. Causes
was interested in establishing W/T assets in PBRUMEN. In : oT
view of Ghis he asked if JMWAVE would continue to assess,
polygraph and train those individuals that ACSI thought _
were suitable W/T candidates, It was indicated that we *

iepeereret ae nt

were cortainly prepared to review all appropriate cases
and would render whatever support was required. This then
resulted in a discussion of whether JMWVAVE would be willing
to monitor ACSI W/T transmissions from PBRUMEN in those
instances where the W/T operator had not been assessed,
polygraphed or trainod by KUBARK. We indicated that we \
would ba glad to moniter, such transmissions if we were
told in advance of the date, time and frequencies on which
tho breadcasts were to be made. This then led to a dis~
cussion of whether JMWAVE would be willing to transmit
C/V messages for ACSY agouts. Here again, we stated that
we would favorably concider any requests for C/V trans-
missions providing that we knew the content of the message,
the identity of the agent who was to receive it, and the

« ..@gent's location and equipment which he might be using.
Lt. Col. Causes stated that in view of this discussion we
could anticipate that he weuld be levying requirements on
us in the near future for support in the W/T field.

jo Seeret Writing. A discussion of 3/W teéhniques iv
revealed that i¥ @ yéquest for the issuance of S/W were ie
recoived from their Miami representative it would be re-
viewed, and if ACSY approved the operation KUBARK would
be asked to issue a system. If JMWAVE agreed via lecal
coordination that the operation in question required the
use of S/W, then this recommendation would bo cabled to
our Washington Headquarters where coordination would be
effocted with ACSI. Once this was accomplished, KUBARK
Washingtgn would cable to JMWAVE the number of the system

t which was \to be issued. JMWAVE would then issue the
system to the ACSI representative in Miami.

3. COMMENT, At the conclusi6a of the above discussion arrange-
ments were fade for lunch, but Lt. Col. Causes chose not to partici-
pate in the luncheon session. During -the luncheon conversation

"Haj. Watlington indicated that he did not believe that Lt. Col.

. Causes would cooperate within the spirit of the DCID's. As a result
he asked that JMWAVE be extremely patient with ACSI until such time -
as Lt. Col. Causes retired and could be replaced. Maj. Watlington

indicated that the retivemeat was scheduled to take place at the
end cf September 1962. At the end of thé luncheon session ar-
rangenonts were made for JENTONS to take Maj. Watlington on a ~
rour of Opa Locka, Based on this tour additional discussions

axe to be held with Maj, Watlington. particularly in regard to
tho development of proceduiles for referral of agents to ACSI
from the Opa Locka flow.

4. OPA LOCKA, Maj. Watlington and JENTONS subsequently
went out to the interrogation center at Opa Locka, Here they
had an interview with Col. Kail, “the tenor of which was, on the
part of Maj. Watlington, to assure himself that the ACSI repre-
sentative, Francasi, was having adequate access to operational
leads. Col, Kail said that operational leads were shared ac-
cording to their abilities between the KUBARK representative and
the, ACSI man. However, there were occasional difficulties in
assuring that the men best qualified received the body in question.
In addition, he said KUBARK. occasionally pulled a man out of the
Center without his completing the full treatment which precluded
the ACSI representative's getting his hands on someone who might
be well qualified for their operations, Maj. Watlington believed
that assurance that the ACSI representative got a fair deal
might be achieved through a more complete briefing of Col.
Trudencio Ulibarri, who is in charge of the preliminary screening
so that he would more fully understand what was needed. JENTONS
said that this would be a very good idea, but that it would be
better if it were a dual briefing with a KUBARK representative
being present as well. Maj. Watlington said that he would ask
his headquarters for permission to have such a briefing given.
Coil, Kail expressed his opinion that the assignment of JENTONS
to formal liaison with the ACSI representatives would do much to
eliwinate present difficulties and all present echoed this pious
thought.

5. AGREEMENT, When JENTONS turned Maj. Watlington over to
Lt. Col. uses after the meeting at Opa Locka, the two ACSI
representatives said that they believed that, for the time being,
it would be better to continue the system as at present, pending
JENTONS' permanent arrival at the beginning of July 1962. As. Lt.
Col. Causes is obviously skeptical about the outcome, this was
agreed to as a stopgap measure.

files ‘of correspondence between Hr. Butler and personne! of various radio-

tations in 16 Latin American count ries.| tn order to build up a market for

the Truth Tapes program in Latin America, Mr. Butler first obtained from the
appropriate consul in New Orleans a list of the radio stations in operation in
his country. He next wrote the administrative personnel of these stations
about the anti-Communist purpose of INCA and offered to supply each station
with Truth Tapes. Those stations requesting them were then provided with a
series of the tapes. One or two years later, Mr. Sutter sent the participating
station a questionnaire designed to elicit information. about audience response
to the Truth Tapes program. Copies of the first questionnaire and of a revised
one are attached for your information. Judging by the responses we read, the
{NCA correspondence files will provide a limited amount of information; dated
i304 aad 1555, an the identification of radio stations in Latin America which
are broadcasting Truth Tapes, their addresses, the names of key personnel, the
identification of stations not responding to the INCA offer, sizes of audiences,
and their responses. Ja the case gf Uruguay, the exchange of correspondence
between!Nr, Gutter and for. Martin Mi queo-Narancio pontained information about
the political orientation OF 8S > personnel “tn Montevideo /HO-TOO7E/.
This example, bowever, is an exception, ce the files contain virtually ro

Id wetecoae r ppestions avout addittonsal topics.
C stions designed to elicié technical information about ‘the station
and its equipment, such as descriptions (manufacturer, type, model) of trans~
mitter, receiver, antenna type and power, frequencies and frequency range, reli-
ability of cquipment, normal and emeryencsy power sources, remote pick-up arrange-
ments, etc. We stressed of course that none of these topics should be introduced
into the questionnaire unless Mr. Butler was convinced of their suitability for
his immediate purpose as well as for the long~tern propaganda alm of his organi-
zation. He stated that our su3gestions were entireiy proser and, in his opinion,
were reasonable requests that would not arouse the station manager's curiosity.
We pointed out to Mr. Butler that, while Information fabout key personnel and —
their political orientation,) about the station's adainistrative policies, etc.,
was of prime importance tous, these subjects obviously could not be introduced
‘into the questfonnaire. He agreed that it would be better to elicit such infor~
mation in another manner, as he had done with(Dr. Miqueo-Narancio,Pbut because
of his very heavy responsibilities, he did not Rava time-to-devefop similar
‘sources of information in each of the other 15 countries.

4, tt occurs to us that you or a possible consumer could assist us by
; suggesting other appropriate topics for Mr. Butler's consideration in the revision
wt of the questionnaire. We shall appreciate whatever help you can glve us In this
regard.

5. tn the meantime, as soon as all of Mr. Butler's current correspondence
been properly filed, we expect ta extract the appropriate information froma

hes
the folders and to present the material in a series of 00-B reports

this avpears unfeasible in view of the fact that there are cra

3) CNEA-5 sugested that [ pursue with THEKiAULT the
possibtlite of developing an interest in Krishna Menon, utilizing
a cleared publisher who could request Menon to write a book, This
a preach to be based on Menon's acute susceptability to flattery.

4) CNEA-5 sugcested that THERKLAULT be asked to review the
areas of her inflvence in order to lay the groundwork for an
official invitation to visit this country being extended to the

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General
SUBJECT “; Howard Hunt

1. At the recent request of the Deputy Director for - ;
Management and Services, the Office of Finance has searched . -

its records to determine if we could find any payment to

Mr. Hunt in an amount of approximately $30,000 that required -
no accounting. | Ss oe, . es

2. We have searched the following records:

a. The expense runs for the period July. 1964 to.
- June 1973 for the immediate. Office of the DCI, _
the immediate Office of the DD/P, FI Staff, ~“*.
CI Staff, CA Staff and the Office of Security. —
We have checked various items that were re- . .
: ‘flected in these expense records but have
identified nothing relating to Mr. Hunt.

a IS- a 7

b.. The| Madrid Station, JMWAVE and FR/Washington
. Office acfountings to determine if there were

. funds passed by the Stations to Mr. Hunt during
the year he served under non-official cover in.
Madrid. We could find no payment to Mr. Hunt ‘
either in his true name or his two identified ««
pseudonyms. oO . eS

c. Mr. Hunt's travel claims for the period
: 1960-1972 and have found nothing in these
travel claims that were not consistent with .
normal travel expenses, i.e., transportation,” «
- per diem. . no , oe

d. We made a specific analysis of Mr. Hunt's
advance account for the period he was under

non-official cover (July '65-Sept '66) and have

SUBJECT: Howard Hunt

determined that $33,500 was advanced to him
for travel and transportation of household
goods to and from Madrid with one trip to
Paris for he and his family to renew their = ;
Spanish visas. All of this advance was fully
accounted for. However, in his accounting, .
one item appeared unusual. It was an CL
expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive.  __ oo ;
operation which was approved for write-off by Mr. | So
- Desmond Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without ;
further accounting. 4

-- 3. Also, we confirmed that no other Agency advance accounts: .
were established for Mr. Hunt during this period. ae ce

_. 4, At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it _
was necessary to establish a bank account in his name. The
_ BUR Division accordingly requested we open an account at the. |
Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr. Hunt's name to receive all non-_ ne,
‘salary payments. (Mr. Hunt had an account at Riggs National ~~ - Poe]
’ Bank to receive his salary and allowance payments). The. bE
following deposits were made to the account during 1965 and.
1966: . :

Account opened: 13 July 1965

13 July 1965 7 $10,000 :
a2 July 1965 5,000
15 September 1965 a 5,000 oe
6 October 1965. ~ + 5,000
‘19 July 1966 mo, 5,000

. $30,000.

All o£ the above have been accounted for by submission —

of travel and transportation accountings.

- 8. We feel at this time without specific guidelines that
further searching would be somewhat fruitless. One strange
aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that
all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the ;

. BUR Division which is not normal as non-official cover people. -

“are usually assigned to a project...It is unusual to have as...

“case officer abroad for one year on-an operational ‘assignment -

6. The Office of Finance has not found operational
' expenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above. ;
Therefore, it is suggested that: Mr. Karamessines be questioned
_as to a project or projects to which Mr. Hunt's operational
expenditures if incurred . would have been charged.

Director to approve my asking la cleare at contact] at. Chase

Ignacy SACHS, upon his return from India, will not
work in’the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but will
be reassigned to the Latin American section of the Polish
Ministry of Foreign Trade. He recently wrote a report on
Latin America based upon material contained in the South
and Central American press. He reportedly had a falling
out with his superiors in the Foreign Ministry, hence the
transfer.

‘The Station copies of the original, reports on SZULC have

and that he co-operated with Tgnacy SACHS, @ cousin who was employed

by the Press Section: of . the Polish Enbassy, and provided him with
"information", , It would, however » be unwise. to jump to the conclusion.
that: this collaboration took the forma of éspionage, since SZULCe does
not seem to have made any secret of the relationship.

I ean find no evidence that Tgnacy SACHS was an intelligence:

; officer, but he seems to have been an active propagandist, He returned

to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,
stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute

This is a Florida Corporation established by and
under the control of JMWAVE and certified to do
business in Florida. Ace Marine Survey, Inc. was
formerly known as Ace Cartography Company, a
corporation which had been certified to do business
in Florida on 11 July 1962. This Corporation was
amended on 4 November 1966 to its new name, Ace
Marine Survey, Inc.

The President of the Corporation is Alfred J.
Moran of New Orleans, Louisiana. Mr. Moran is a
very prominent businessman in the New Orleans
area. He is head of Kalvar and has investments
in a variety of businesses which include many oil
interests. He is known to Headquarters represen-
tatives particularly in Logistics.

OSTENSIBLE BUSINESS: Ace Marine Survey, Inc., is engaged primarily

USE :

FUNDING

in marine research including the study of marine
life and testing of marine equipment. However,
its general provisions permit it to perform almost
any corporate function.

JMWAVE use of the Corporation is to provide cover
for a maritime vessel, the M/V SONORA. The Corpora-
tion provides status cover and payrolling of the
agents assigned to the M/V SONORA and the safe area
or berthing site from which the vessel operates in
the performance of its ostensible business. a4

ticket together with the appropriate deposit slips
for the various corporations is then turned over

teller on the given business day. Since the number
of transactions handled by a given teller may go

as high as 250 to 300 there is slight chance of

the deposits being attributed to the particular
credit ticket which accompanied these deposits.

1.

and payrolling for 10 Cubans as of 31 January
1967.

Maritime Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967:
This cover company should be affected little by

a flap. However, because of the berthing location
within largely tourist or recreation areas, its
commercial activity has been noted.

Cover Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967:

A successor to Ace Cartography Company, Ace Marine
Survey, Inc., is currently used in connection with
the leasing of a waterfront berthing site for the
berthing of M/V SONORA, which is registered under
this firm. The firm also provides cover and serves
as well as the vehicle for payrolling the agent crew.

Ace Marine Survey, Inc.,is engaged in the field of
marine research, including the study of marine life
as well as the testing of marine equipment.

In view of the current limited use of this cover,

the likelihood of exposure is considerably reduced.
However, if such an exposure did occur, it is felt
that the damage to either WOFACT or the officers

of Ace Marine Survey, Inc., would be of no great
import. The major likely "injury" that would be
sustained would be the denial of further use of the
berthing site and the need for re-naming/re-register-
ing the M/V SONORA.

In order to add depth and lend further substance

to the cover story, the officers of a legitimate Qy/
firm,[ Offshore Navigation Company, New Orleans,
Louisiana, which is engaged in marine research and
off-shore oil exploration activities, have agreed

to backstop the activities of Ace Marine Survey, Inc.
and to recognize the latter firm as a client.

ASSESSMENT OF VULNERABILITY:

1.

Maritime Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967 —- The cover
mechanism established by the Ceres Enterprises, Inc. was very
secure during the period of its operation and remained so
until the loss of one of its agents who was captured in Cuba.
This made it necessary to terminate the activities of this
corporation and transfer its activities to another entity.
This was accomplished without any unusual events or actual
public exposure. If any should occur at this late date, the
damage would be minimal.

Cover Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967 - This corporation

is currently inactive and will become legally dormant after
three years. It was placed in this status due to an operational
flap which could have exposed the corporation. The last active
tax return was filed at the tax year ending March 31, 1966.

An additional tax return will be filed for the past tax year
which will indicate no financial transactions.

Its assets and activities were transferred to other JMWAVE
entities. This corporation was established to provide cover
for a Maritime Branch vessel and status and payroll cover for
the agents assigned to it. The corporation is inactive and
will be allowed to remain so. It was placed in this status
due to a flap wherein an agent was captured in Cuba who had
knowledge of this vessel and its ownership. There was no
public exposure in the Miami area. However, because of the
past incident the corporation should not be used in the future
under its current name. While in use the corporation served
very satisfactorily for the purpose for which it was established.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with ©. Howard Hunt Re His Memoirs, "Undercover"

1, On 28 September 1974 Ray Rocca, Deputy Chief/CI Staff, ©
and I met in the DCD Washington Field Office with E. Howard Hunt,
his attorney William A. Snyder, Jr., and Snyder's associate
Thomas W. Coons. As the meeting began, Hunt asked if it was -
being tape-recorded; I assured him that it was not. He said he did ©
not care; but that, if it were to be recorded, he would like to know.
We then embarked upon the review according to the plan under which
we would demand the deletion of three items as classified and then
proceed to the remaining 29 items, only if Hunt was cooperative on
the first three. He and his lawyers appeared very cooperative, and
accordingly, the meeting continued to cover all 32 items.

Pere , 2. Changes were agreed to in the items set forth in paragraphs

° 12, 14, and 25 of the CI Staff memorandum of 19 September 1974.
These appear at pages 73, 80-83, and 115 of the galley proof and
concern the fabrication of the Shanghai post for a Mexican operation,
the entry into the Guatemalan Embassy in Mexico City, and the joint
CIA-Uruguayan telephone monitoring operation. The wording of the
agreed changes is as’ shown on the attached copies of the pertinent
pages of the galley proof. Essentially, these changes disguise the
identity of the fabricated newspaper and remove a reference to
journalists as agents; delete the word "Guatemalan" to make the
entered embassy non-specific; and delete the reference to listening
posts and telephone monitoring to make that paragraph refer in more
general terms to our ability to cover targets without referring to the
use of electronic surveillance.

3. We then proceeded to the 29 items which we would like to
see modified but which we could not consider classified. We made
this clear to Hunt and went through them one by one, discussing our
concern with each. Hunt contended that most of these items.should
not be considered sensitive since they had been publicized extensively;
in some cases confirmed in testimony; and,in the case of other
items, the principals involved were dead. However, he agreed to
changes in the items referred to in paragraphs 1, 3, 17, and 32 of
the CI Staff memorandum of 19 September. These involve the deletions
of the names of Henry Pleasants and Frank Holcomb, both now
retired under cover; a direct reference to joint operations with the
British in Hong Kong against China; and the wording of his reference
to CIA alias documentation used by the Watergate burglars. The
language of this last item will be changed so that it no longer leaves
the impression that the documentation was prepared by the Agency
for this operation.

4, When we had finished, Hunt and his lawyers emphasized
as they had mentioned earlier in the meeting that it might be very
difficult to get the publisher to agree to changes in the unclassified
items. Mr. Snyder offered to present all of the items to the publisher
for change without distinguishing between the classified and unclassi-
fied items. He said he would do this without implying they were all
classified. I felt it necessary to turn down his offer because of the
risk of the publisher being unwilling to accept that many changes
with the result that we would have to go back to him on the three
classified items, thus presenting a situation similar to our retraction
of previously demanded deletions in the Marchetti book. I think
there would be some danger of the publisher using this in his adver-
tising and through reviewers for publicity purposes.

5. As we were leaving, Hunt showed me what was described
as a "comfort letter.'' This was a letter written by him to the
publishers on 17 May 1974 at the publisher's request which said
that in his opinion nothing in the manuscript violated any agreement
between himself and the CIA, nor would subject him to prosecution
under the espionage laws. As the meeting was ending, Hunt expressed
his hope that no publicity would be given to it and that the Agency
would not issue any kind of a press release. In view of the Director's
decision that we shall issue a press release, I took pains to persuade
Hunt that public acknowledgment of the fact that we had reviewed his

‘manuscript would be in his interest as well as ours. He had referred
more than once during the meeting to the need to avoid the appearance
of "a bear hug"; in other words, collusion or cooperation between him
and the Agency, leaving an inference that the book was designed to be
a whitewash of CLA. In view of this, it was easy to convince Hunt
that an Agency press release would be in his interest. I would note
here, however, that both Mr. Rocca and I felt that Hunt and his
lawyers were genuinely cooperative and that a press release which

is too harsh or denigrates the book or Hunt's motives might be unfair _
and considered by him to be in bad faith. Hunt appears to retain
admiration and respect for the Agency and seems convinced that
nothing in his book will harm our operations or personnel.

is too harsh or denigrates the book or Hunt's motives might be unfair
and considered by him to be in bad faith. Hunt appears to retain
admiration and respect for the Agency and seems convinced that
nothing in his book will harm our operations or personnel.

Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO

IDENTIFICATION: NOSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet

: ; KGB officer who defected in 1964 and
was subsequently involuntarily con-
fined in the U.S. by the Agency for
a period of approximately three years.

BACKGROUND : NOSENKO first contacted Agency. per-
: sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962
and subsequently defected in January
1964. NOSENKO was brought to the U.S.
and after a period of relative freedom
he was involuntarily confined in
April 1964. . From April 1964 to
August 1965, he was confined at an
Agency controlled site in Clinton,
Maryland. From,August, 1965 to
October 1967, NOSENKO was confined
: at Camp Peary, Virginia. In October
Sos: 1967, he was returned to the Washington
L area, given increasing amounts of
freedom until he was given totai free-
i dom in April 1969, NOSENKO became 2
: U.S. citizen in April 1974. NOSENKO
was employed by the Agency as a
consultant in March 1969 and continues
under contract to date. His present
salary is $23,500 per year.

APPROVAL : (1) .The legal basis to confine NOSENKO
. against his will was discussed by

Mr. Richard Helms, DD/P, and others with
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Houston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
proper (Tab 2).

(2) There are a series of letters from
the DDCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Department of
Justice and the White House, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, evidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3).

(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's confine-
ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 § 5).

TERMINATION

COMMENTS

By memorandum dated 2 October 1968,
the Director of Security forwarded
two reports to the DDCI summarizing
the results of the NOSENKO case to
that date. The reports are voluminous,
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI.
Both reports conclude that NOSENKO
was a bona fide defector. A draft
memorandum attached.to this file,
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raises question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides

and challenges the above two reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

the Agency. He is brought to Washington
periodically to consult on matters.
germane to his background and experience.
Various reports are available in the
files of the Office of Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.
No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

do document the rationale for the original
confinement of NOSENKO, they do not
document the rationale for his continued
confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated 5S August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document

‘a period in 1969 during which a mail

cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
During this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at least two
occasions.

id)
FROM : (William H. Godson)
/R&A/O
SUBJECT : Herbert Itkin File

1. f have reviewed the material in the Herbert Itkin
file which is divided into two main divisions. The first
concerns the details of Itkin's use as an unpaid witting
informant on matters concerning an attempt by Haitian exiles
in 1963 to unseat then President Duvalier. This involved
a large number of contacts with Haitian exiles in New York,
Washington, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Itkin
became a idegal advisor for a Haitian Government-In-Exile and
put up $15,000 of his "own funds" for this Haitian enterprise.
Bernard E. MONCURE (P) a CI Staff staff agent in New York,
rode piggy-back on Itkin's contacts with the Haitians to make
his own operational contacts within the group. He also
provided a small amount of money to them ($4,300) from CIA
funds. It would seem from information in the file that there
was high-level governmental interest in removing Duvalier
from office in 1963. This information is contained in hand-
written notes which are paraphrased and indicate high-level
interest in the activities of the Haitian exile group. (I
suggest that this material be kept in case there are Freedom
of Information Act requests on CIA activities involving Haiti
in 1962-1963.)

: 2. The second and bulkier section of material concerns
Itkin's efforts to involve MONCURE and CIA in his attempts to
secure custody of his wife's children from her second marriage.
Itkin had been heavily involved as a lawyer and confidant with
Mafia syndicates and labor unions, particularly the teamsters.
While doing this he had gained a large amount of information
on the Mafia. In March 1963, MONCURE had recruited Itkin for
the FBI for domestic issues while maintaining for CIA the use
of Itkin for foreign intelligence matters. The FBI and the
federal prosecutors in New York starting in 1968 found Itkin
to be a very important witness in a series of criminal indict-
ments starting with New York City Water Commissioner Marcus.

Itkin and his wife had for a long time been :struggling to
maintain custody over her children from her second marriage.
Claiming that she had violated the custody stipulations of
a New York court by moving them more than 50 miles from New
York without his permission, Frederick Hersh, Mrs. Itkin's
former husband, gained custody of the children by means of
a ruling from the British court in 1966. Mrs. Itkin began
legal procedures in New York to regain the children. As
part of their effort they swore affadavits that Mrs. Itkin:
had taken the children to England at the request of the CIA.
itkin embellished on his CIA record by stating that he had
worked for CIA for many years prior to 1963, and insisted
that his original contact had been set up between Harold
Stassen and Allen Dulles in Philadelphia in the summer of
1954. Most of these assertions were fabrications. MONCURE's
CIA relationship was exposed in various legal circles in
New York. The Agency wanted to avoid MONCURE's having to.
contradict Mr. and Mrs. Itkins' affadavits in court. The
FBI seemed to have been more interested in protecting Itkin's
reputation as a witness than in protecting MONCURE's reputa-
tion for honesty. ;

3. MONCURE did not appear in court. The Federal
authorities eventually placed protection around Itkin and
his wife, keeping them on a military reservation, while:
he appeared as a star witness in numerous Mafia cases which
led to covictions. : 3

2

4.,. One small side issuegis worth noting: (Chomas L.
Roberts) who was a(law partner of Itkin)until mid-1961, became
a(CIA staff agent under cover in Africa)?4The many fraudulent
activities of Itkin spread a scintilla of suspicion around

oberts The latter was given a polygraph examination in

‘rankfurt. He answered questions on his relationship with
Itkin including financial and his few contacts with Marcus
to the satisfaction of his interrogators.

5. Comments: The thrust of the file is mainly defensive.
CIA was reacting to Itkin's tactics to help his wife gain cus-
tody over her children. Itkin's numerous trips to England
and Europe were made on behalf of the FBI, and they were part
of an FBI attempt to-gain information on the Mafia. Before
the recruitment of Itkin and his utilization by the FBI, CIA
did pass to the Attorney General in 1963 information on a
Department of Labor official's alleged criminal involvement
with the Mafia, which MONCURE had elicited from Itkin. The
file also refers to MONCURE's continued contact with one Mafia
figure Lenzieri, who was a legal client, as a means of self-
protection as Lenzieri represented a channel back to the Mafia

&

tae. SEURET a

for MONCURE, who was apprehensive of Mafia retaliation because
of his involvement with Itkin. .

6. I have talked to Will Kerbe who is presently the
case officer in contact for MONCURE. He says that MONCURE
is in limited law practice and is drawing a pension from
the Agency as well as a contract for services connected with
Golitsyn. There is probably nothing in the file which could
damage MONCURE's security as much of the information
regarding his association with Itkin has already been exposed.
The most recent information in the file is a January 1975
memorandum for the record from Acting Chief, CI, which oo
states that John K. Greaney, Assistant General Counsel had .. ~.
learned that Seymour Hersh had learned details of the Itkin-: -
MONCURE relationship. It would appear that Mr. Greaney is -
the most knowledgeable person in the agency on the legal
aspects of the Itkin.case and probably maintains his own
files. .

In March 1953 the SCHLUMBERGER file reflects that an FBI source
furnished information that. one Maurice Henri MARTIN, employed as an -
enginear by the SCHLUMBERGER Company, Paris, France, received a letter
éated 27 July 1951 at Moscow from one SiegPied Gtefanovitch MOROSOFF,
asking MARTIN for specialized information concerning geophysics. The ;
letter requested that MARTIN's reply be forwarded to Moscow through an inter-

mediary. From January 1932 until April 1937 MARTIN represented the SCHLUMBERGER

Company in Russia as an engineer, and it was thought that the correspondence
from MOROSOFF may represent a Soviet attempt to resume contact with MARTIN
and Gevelop clandestine relations with him. The FBI conducted an investi«
gation dated Jime 1953 and determined that Maurice Henri MARTIN resided

at Nod Hill, Wilton, Connecticut end was employed by the SCHLUMBERGER

Well Surveying Co., Ridgefield, Connecticut. Informants advised that
eithough MARTIN was strongly nationalistic toward France, he pave every
4ndication of being anti-Russian and there was no evidenced? CP activities.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. I showed Mr. George Carey his memorandum of 1955
to the Director referring to T. and H., and said we thought
that H. referred to a General Hardin. After considerable
speculation Mr. Carey finally placed T. as being Juan Trippe
and Hardin as an Air Force General who was being placed with

24 @an Anm)for operational reasons, primarily technical information

collection. Independently Mrs. Lovejoy had checked with Mr.
Larocque, and he also recalled General Hardin was a man

Mr. Carey was interested in placing with (Pan Am for operational
reasons. zy

2. The Air Force Register lists a General Thomas O,
Hardin, Air Force Major General, who retired in 1955, which
would seem to fit in as he is listed as an airline executive.
Mr. Carey had no knowledge whatsoever of the Itkin case, and
we felt it was out of the question that General Hardin is

synonymous with Philip Harbin.

SUBJECT: Herbert Itkin Do Not Reproduce!

1. A meeting was held on 27 January 1969 with Messrs.

Rocca, Houston, Warner and myself to discuss the ramifications

of the confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January.

It was concluded that additional information was required on
03(Thomas Le Roberts) and (Robert Delsog.°> 1 contacted the Director

of Security and requested the security files on these two individuals

and was advised that we could not have the security files but that

Mr. Ward Greene would bring the files to the office and discuss

their contents openly,

03 2, On 29 Fanuary, Mr. Greene brought the security files
on (Roberts) and elson) and was most cooperative in explaining
their contents, “Attached is a chronological rundown on the
pertinent information on (homas L. Roberts} affiliation with
the FBI, CIA and Itkin. 03

3. On 30 January a *reeting was held°with Messrs. Houston,
Warner, Rocca, and fugene Milligan), ccs /LPGLOBE, to discuss
the operational use of Mr. Roberts, Mr obert9) has been a
Staff Agent of CIA since 3B August 1961, From March 1964 to
alpyember 1964 he spent time in (West Afric writing a monograph
on (West African legal)problems. /° It should “be noted that this
task was performed under a grant from a foundation which was
blown in the MHDOWEL exposures. In November 1964 Roberts) oF
was assigned for Cover to the(Radio Corporation of America zy
legal) staff where he remained until March 1965 and then went
to (@aka?,

o

4, The facts in the attached chronology are subject to
question since they are the result of (Roberts} own explanation of
his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from
independent sources, The most critical aspect would appear to
be the owledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of

O Roberts affiliation with CIA. This knowledge is borne out by

03

( 2pf

the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly bring? oberts¥ name
into the story which Itkin develops about his CIA affiliations.

One of the questions to be. answered by @PGLOBE personnel is
whether or not (Robe2ts) reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva,
Switzerland, in March 1966. There appears to be no record of

(Roberts having explained why he never pursued the Itkin debt or

what his financial contribution was to the (law firm of Itkin, Robertso&
and Greenbaum.)

5. Mr. Rocca was advised by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI
that the New, York District Attorney may be considering prosecution
against Rovéeey for having absconded with funds received from
negligence cases. We do not have sufficient information to evaluate
the likelihood of criminal prosecution. It may be necessary to
discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office,

Pe)

6. With regard to Robert Debsos) there appear to have been
two operational considerations, one having been a request to use
him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February
1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations
Division for his use on Project WUBRINY. In March 1964 DO
Division advised Security that (Delson was not going to be used
on WUBRINY. Mr. Rocca comniénted that there are some rather
ominous allegations against members of the firm of (Delson, Levinu&S
and Gordon)) indicating that one member of the firm was a card-
carrying member of the Communist Party. At the present time
Mr. Rocca is investigating the DITPILLAR use of Mr. (Belson)

purposes, however, ve estimate he will be required on or about 6 March 1967.

3. ft is understood from Gisenssions with Collina representatives at
Rewport Beach, Celifornia, that engineering services of thie tyne cost
apcroximately $3,000 per nonth in addition to travel expenses. We recommend f

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Support Branch DATE: 1 July 1963
FROM. : Mr. Ramon R. Hart :
SUBJECT : Manuel F. ARTIME Buesa

#210 838

1. On 24 June 1963, Mr. Charles Matt, SAS/MOB/PM, extension
6488, was referred to me by the SAS Security Officer, Mr. George
Iadner, and visited me in Room 4 — 21 to request some operational
support beginning 1 July 1963. Mr. Matt advised that two leaders
of the Cuban Exile Group were coming to Washington, D. C., on that
latter date to confer with CIA and other Government officials,
including probably Robert F. Kennedy, the Attorney General, concern-
ing the "new program” for the exiles,

%, Mr. Matt explained that a covert site (#302 922) located
at/ 9218 Aldershot Drive » Bethesda,|Maryland, had recently been
procured to billet these exiles and to serve as the meeting place
for these sensitive discussions to take place. Mr. Matt said that
SAS is vitally interested in what these two exiles say to each other
when the U. S. Government officials have departed after a day's
discussions. He, therefore, requested that microphones be concealed
in the house to monitor their comments.

3. Mr. Matt said that the two men would arrive on 1 July and
would be in Washington at the house for about a week or ten days.
. The audio coverage was requested for this entire time. Mr. Matt
also said that the house would be retained for several more months
<i and that the two exiles would return to Washington several more
=} times in that period and that an audio surveillance would probably
S| be requested for these latter visits also.

— 4, Mr. George Ladner supplied the true name of the leader of
ca the two men, the captioned Subject. Having been informed by Mr.

a | Matt that the coyert site was a private dwelling place in an

~-~-¥ expensive neighborhood, I assumed that there would be only two

oe. _{ methods of making an audio penetration of the premises:

(a.) Concealing a tape recorder in the attic, base-
ment, or garage, and using a voice-operated
relay to actuate the recorder.

(b.) With the use of directories, search the
environs of the safehouse for the purpose
of locating a potential listening post where
radio transmissions could be monitored.

5. After checking with Mr. Joseph langan, Acting Chief,
Operational Support Division, I assigned the case to the District
Field Office and directed some agents to case the house and the
neighborhood to determine which method of penetration should be
used. Mr. John Cryer was designated responsible agent at the
District Field Office, and after a quick survey, he reported that
the concealment and servicing of a tape recorder on the premises
would be impossible and that the only method would be the use of
a@ transmitter and a nearby listening post.

6. Using the directories in SRS, I ran the names of all the

residents of the houses within a quarter-mile i) gthe covert site
& tems SRD Indices and found ong [Fred C. Thomad> Jr.) (#57 328),

of} 912T McDonald Drive, Bethesda, Maryland, to be a Starr employee.
Through telephone information, located Mr.j Thomas} at the Langley
Headquarters Building and personally contacted him the first thing
in the morning of 25 June 1963. I indicated to Mr. (Th g]}the fact
that there was a safehouse in his neighborhood which we wanted to
"bug" and that he was the only Staff employee who lived within range
of our covert transmitters. I asked him if it would be too mich of
an pags ton 6m him for us to set up a listening post in_his house.
Mr. [Théwhs \explained that he was scheduled to depart for [Karachi, i 0
Pakistan} on a PCS assignment in approximately a month but that he
would bé“glad to make his home available as listening post. He
confided that his primary mission in/Karachi jwas to be the audio a)
penetration of the] Commnist Chinese Embassy land so_he would look . uf
forward to the next week's operations in his”home as valuable Fo
training. The next step I took was to set up & meeting among
George Ladner, Charles Matt, Sam Halpern, Executive Officer of SAS,
and myself in Mr. Halpern's Office. I advised Mr. Halpern that the

}

SECRET .°

Page Three
#210 838

audio surveillance appeared to: be technically feasible since I
had located a possible listening post. However, I admitted

to him that, even though the Office of Security has the "charter"
to conduct the surveillance, TSD controls the necessary expensive
equipment; Mr. Halpern mist arrange for TSD to transfer this
equipment to the Office of Security. Mr. Halpern declared that
the procurement of the necessary equipment should pose no problem
after he would mike a few telephone calls. I then returned to
my office and made out a list of the equipment which I felt
would be necessary, and awaited advice from him as to whom to
contact in TSD to obtain it. 03

7. After checking with ur. (Bi T, Bentlof the Audio Opera~
tions Branch of TSD as to appropriate equipment and after check-
ing through the specifications in the "Audio Manual" of TSD,

I selected the following:

Two voice-cperated relays, QSC-2, $2,200.00
$1,100 each

Two Transmitter Radios, FM, 130 ~ 140 550.00
MCS, SRT-6H, @ $275 each .

Two Battery Packs, 130 hrs. ops., 50.00
UWB-7, $25 each

Two Battery "A", 1.5 volts, Burgess 2 F 1.08
$ . 54 each

One Battery "B", 45 volts, Burgess A-30 1.87
$1.87 each

TOTAL $2,802.95

8. About Noon on 25 June, I received a telephone call from
Mr. John W. McBee, extension aksi, of TSD, who told me that every-
thing had been laid on by SAS for me to obtain from TSD any

SECRET

equipment necessary for this operation. Mr. McBee directed that
I fill out a Form #88 and have the technicians hand carry it to
the Franconia Depot in order to obtain the equipment. The use of
the Form #88 disturbed me in this matter because I had assumed
from Mr. Halpern that he would arrange it so that TSD would turn
over the equipment to us without charge to anyone. ‘The use of
the Form #88 implies that a division is allocating funds for the
purchase of equipment. However, I filled out the Form #88,
listing the above equipment, and walked it down to SAS, where I
gave it to Charles Matt to have signed. The form, bearing the
SAS Cost Center #3132-5455~3400, was completed and returned to
me within an hour, whereupon I gave it to DFO Agent Stan Lach,
who drove with it immediately to the Franconia Depot. I called
ahead to Bob Woods and Charlie Beall of the T & I Shop at Franconia
and requested that they give a little briefing concerning the
operation of this equipment to Mr. Lach and Mr. Cryer, who was to
meet Mr. Lach there. Neither Cryer nor Lach had eyer had any
experience with any of the pieces of equipment on the list. Mr.
Woods and Mr. Beall were quite cooperative in this request.

9. Several problems kept appearing and disappearing while
the DFO technicians were transporting, installing, and testing
the equipment. One problem was the payment of the equipment. I;
received a telephone call from Mr. Dayton S. ("Doc") Barrows of
TSD, informing me that SAS had reneged on paying the $2,802.95 for
the equipment, but that if I would tell him what equipment we
wanted, he might be able to arrange to lend it to us. I told Mr.
Barrows that as far as I knew, we had indeed obtained the equipment
with the Form #88, but that if we needed anything else, I would
contact him. Another problem which appeared was the rumor that
it was not two Cuban exiles who would be residing in the safehouse,
but only the captioned Subject and a Spanish speaking Staff employee.
If the rumor were actually true, it would seem that an audio
surveillance of the safehouse would not be necessary. I called
Charles Matt for an explanation, and he informed me that Senor
Artime was going to be the only person living in the house after
each day's discussions were completed - no Staff employee would
be living with him. I asked Mr. Matt to whom Senor Artime would be

holding the conversations which we were to record, He replied
that he was interested in any visitors which the Subject might
receive and any telephone calls which he might mike. I suggested
that possibly a telephone tap might be sufficient under these
circumstances. Mr. Matt disagreed and still requested a micro-
phone installation to cover the whole house if possible.

10. In addition to the equipment obtained from TSD, the DFO
agents took their own SRR-4 tuneable receiver and the SRR-4 charged
to the WFO. These receivers would be used in the listening post to
pick up the radiations from the two SRT-6H transmitters. It was
suggested to the DFO agents to borrow the two WFO transceivers to
be used to commmicate during the installation between the listening
post and the safehouse; however, the agents chose not to use them
and relied solely on telephonic commmications. The "A" and "B"
batteries picked up at Franconia were to be used in the SRR-4
receiver so that checks could be made from an automobile to see
just how far the radiations extended around the transmitters. A
report on the area covered by the transmitters was requested of
the DFO agents.

{ ll. The first test of the SRI-6H from the safehouse to the
/ listening post was a failure. Its 50 milliwatt output, ordinarily

{ good for a quarter mile, wasn't sufficient to reach the receiver,

i
i
!

2/loth's of a mile away, Its failure was blamed partly on the
distance, partly on the brick construction of the listening post,
and partly on the hilly contours of the housing development, which
deflected the 135 megacyele, line-of-sight radiations.

12. When this disheartening news arrived, I immediately
telephoned Mr. Barrows of TSD and requested a pair of the more
powerful 150 milliwatt SRT-7 transmitters. I telephoned Mr.
Barrows rather than filling out another Form #88 to avoid a
possible furor within SAS. Mr. Barrows consented to loan two of
these transmitters with their proper receivers on a hand receipt
to us, and Stan Lach was dispatched to Franconia to pick them up.
An opportunity to test it on 28 June 1963 was thwarted because
Mr. S]was having foreign visitors in for cocktails tuuiheseme
that afternoon. But the equipment was installed and tested the
next day, Saturday, 29 June, and appeared to work satisfactorily.

date him until the day he suddenly disappeared from Guatemala City
on 24 January 1961. She had, in fact, expected him for dinner the even-

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT : Herbert Itkin/Mario Brod et.al.

1. Reference is made to your instructions concerning this
case and my attached memorandum concerning research on whether >
or not Itkin was ever, in fact, utilized by this Agency prior to his :
contacts with Brod.

2. All available sources in the Agency reflect no record of
Itkin or of Philip Harbin, who was allegedly his case officer. Harbin
has been checked both as a true mame and as an alias. Although the
name is not registered in the Agency, this of course does not mean
} that some Agency representative did not make this up and use it
without telling anyone.

3. My visceral reaction is that Itkin is lying about his
contacts with Mr. Dulles and Philip Harbin. However, since there
appears to be a possibility of an extreme "flap" if Itkin gives the same
story to the-newspapers that he gave to Mr. Houston, I would recommend
that, with the concurrence of Mr. Helms, Mr. Dulles be interviewed and
asked if he remembers anything about this case. - «
aa

4. Lalso spoke with Harry Mason, x5231, in Finance who
handles OS budgetary matters and is a personal acquaintance. Without
giving him any names I asked him if it would be possible to track down
the receipt that Itkin claims he gave Harbin for the $5000.00. Harry
says if the case was handled properly and the account is still outstanding
it will be fairly easy to find the receipt. I have done nothing further on

this, pending your instructions.

ITKIN, Herbert .

Subject States:

When he was first admitted to the bar in 1953
he was employed by the firm of Delson, Levin & Gordon
in New York City. (Now Delson and Gordon.) Itkin
alleges that one partner, Levin, had close ties with
Alger Hiss, Cyrus Eaton and other of similar persuasion.
Because of the viewpoint of the law firm, Subject states
that he began passing information to Senator Joseph
McCarthy. However, in the Spring of 1954, Senator
McCarthy told Itkin that he was getting into trouble and
allegedly reported that he had passed Itkin's reports to
CIA. Itkin then states that a meeting was set up for
him either in June/July/or August of 1954 with Mr. Allen
Dulles. This meeting was at the Bellevue Stratford in
Philadelphia. His contact was reportedly a man known
as Philip Harbin.

At this time, Itkin says he was able to report on
matters affecting U Nu, then the Premier of Burma, the
Indonesian Foreign Minister; and the owner or editor
of the New Delhi Times. Itkin also claims to have had
personal contacts with Luis Gutierrez, Consul General
of El Salvador, and with a number of other people who
had Guatemalan contacts. Itkin says the only money he
received from Harbin was $5,000.00, which was supposed
to be repayable and for which he gave a receipt, he believes
sometime in 1957, He said the money was notsrepaid.

Itkin states that he met Mario Brod in 1961 and
that Brod was represented to him as a former Colonel
in the OSS who had intelligence connections. From then
on his contact was Brod and apparently Harbin dropped
out of the picture.

record of Philip Harbin in OS pseudo files.

record of Philip Harbin as either a pseudo or

a registered alias in RI/CRYPTO.

record of Philip Harbin in RI files.

The file of Mario Brod reflects no information concerning his
contacts with Herbert Itkin and reflects no information concerning a

Philip Harbin.

During Itkin's meeting with Mr. Houston he mentioned that the
law firm had a negro lawyer named Thomas L. Roberts, #193026, who
had very useful contacts with the United Nations. Itkin stated that
Roberts was a very presentable and intelligent negro who left the firm
and now had a law practice in Dakar.

_ The Office of Security file concerning Roberts reflectsthat:

of
Mr. Roberts|is a current employee of this Agency

under doep cover in Dakar] In January of 1968 Roberts
furnished this Office with an extensive summary of his

past association with Herbert Itkin. He also mentioned

that he and Itken had associated with Mario Brod at a dinner
party in 1965 and had had lunch with Brod in 1967. There is
no indication, however, that Roberts is aware of any use of
Itken aa a CIA informant during the 1950's.

that th@( PSYCHOLOGICAL ASEESSWiNT ASSOCIATES) (see copy of SR
iT an 4 orandum dated 21.

_ Memoran dated 3-F.
Febrvary 1 61) shoul bel utilized. This decisionws made
‘as a result of a conversation between Mr. Howard OSBORNE,

Deputy Chief, SR Division, and Mr. Jack SOUTHARD, Chief, ccc /Nc.

3. <A meeting was called on 27 February 1961 to determine
the type of cover organization that should be substituted for
this purpose. After considering the matter a ength, it was
ascertained that the Agency has a cleared (emp. lyment) service in

(0 Pittsburgh) which could possibly be utilized as an initial q
assessment. This firm, the EMPLOYNENT SERVICE COMPANY, ?
is located in the Union Trust Buildi , Pittsburgh, Pennsyivania,) fo
and is managed by(argaret A. x LRIET) (see SSD File 95018).
It was agreed that if the(EMPLOYEHS SERVICE COMPANY could
provide the needed cover, two OTR psychologists’ would be docu-
mented in true name with that firm in(Pittsburglhio CcG (Frank
... O'MALIEY) will make a trip to(Pittsburgh),in the next few days
to determine whether Miss (AREY is amenable to the proposed
arrangement.d9 The two psychologist$ ‘'gelected were Doctors
BrADT and McKEE,on whom credit checks were recently completed
. ‘to jth negative results as to Agency employment.
at cee! “ae
et Wh, It was further ascertained at this time that Mr.

outside the Washington, D. C. area. Most of the training will
be conducted in an SR safe house in New York. The SR revresen-
tative will probably request a safe house in Baltimore for the
final assessment and processing of those REDSKIN Agents that

are cleared in the initial screening by either BRADT” or{iekEE} 06,
It should be noted at this point that SR Division plans to
process thirty or thirty-five REDSKIN Agents this year. Time
is, of course, of the essence, in view of the fact that these
people will have t- be assessed, security-cleared, briefed,

and trained, and arrangements for grants made before the sumer
season. °

SUBJECT: COVER, (sonoFFrcrAt - GENERAL
(Proposal for A&E Assessment of Potential
# 90b BN Agent Candidates)

; 1. Reference is made to my previous memorandum pertaining
to the proposal to initiate a change of policy with respect to
the processing of potential REDSKIN Agents. 7

2, As will be noted, it was initially recommended that
potential. RECSKIN Agent candidates be provided with an A#E assess-
ment by OTR prior to disclosure of Agency interest in them and
prior to the disclosure of any Shine a Goreftiot & This

assessment will be conducted utilizing a (nonofficial cover)» ge :
was initially suggested that TSD's Psychological, Assessment :
Associates firm now used by Dr. GITTINGER be used for this purpose.
If the A&E assessment were favorable, Security would be requested
to conduct a full investigation of the Subject and he would be
subsequently contacted under alias CIA credentials. At that point,
he would be requested to perform a mission for us and would be
given requirements for same if he agreed to accept such assignment.

t

3. Attention is invited to the attached memorandum dated
8 February 1961. A copy of this memorandum was’ furnished to . : -f
the writer with the verbal request that credit checks be conducted i
on all the staff A&E members mentioned. Prior to the initiation
of credit checks, it was verbally agreed between the undersigned and
Mr. Thomas STRANGE, CCG/NC, that no credit check would be conducted
on Jacob GOLDER, in view of the fact that it was known the latter

1

-was recently surfaced as an Agency employee. The requested credit .
checks were completed on or about 16 February 1961 and the results £, waren |
verbally transmitted to Mr. Thomas STRANGE, £ PY coaart wt AB. | :
: " an phe ey (2 :
lh. As of this date, CCG feels that they mey have to establish a

another notional cover for this program. It is understood that ces
this cover will be utilized in addition to utilizing the (Psychological 24
a , Assessment Associates. \Pending a further request in this ratter
2K from CCG, no further aetion is contemplated.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security 4 May 1967

SUBJECT : MORGAN, Edward P.

1. I first met Ed Morgan in about 1952 or 1953 through our
association with the Society of Former Agents of the FBI. Both Ed
and I served on the Executive Committee of the Washington Chapter
of that Society in 1953-54 and both Ed and I were interested in having
the Ex-Agents National Convention in Washington, D. C. At that time
Jim McInerny was President of the Washington Chapter.

2. I went overseas in 1955 and I have seen Ed possibly four or
five times since my return in 1957. While I have been active in the
Society, Ed Morgan has not been. The last time I saw Morgan was
in January 1967 at an Ex-Agents dinner. All of my association with
Morgan has been through the Ex-Agents, and I have never been in
contact with him socially other than through the Society.

3. The following information is hearsay concerning Ed Morgan.
I have reason to believe that all the information is true, but I do not
know it on a first hand basis. Ed Morgan served in the Bureau from
1940 to 1947. He isa tall, personable, nice looking individual and in
the Bureau he ended up in the Training Division. He used to give
lectures to the new Agents classes and the National Academy classes,
and through his speaking ability he came to the attention of Director,
J. Edgar Hoover. At the end of the war Morgan left the Bureau to
enter private law practice.

4. According to rumor, Morgan entered the field of Federal
Communications practice. His firm became well known in this field
and the firm name is Welch, Mott & Morgan. Rumor is that he obtained
TV franchises for a number of oil men in the Middle West, and took
his pay in oil leases. He made a-great deal of money in a short period
of time and is reportedly worth at least a million dollars.

wee


Page 2:
ze

5. At the time of the Korean War, Morgan accepted an
appointed position in the Office of Price Stabilization. He headed
the investigative and compliance unit of OPS and in this position he
hired a number of Ex-Agents. It was in this job that he reportedly
ran afoul of the Bureau. Morgan apparently proselyted a great number
of Bureau Agents at higher salaries than the Bureau made and this
made Director Hoover furious. A few years later a rumor was
started that Morgan hoped to replace Hoover; the Director was even
more furious. I do not know this for a fact, but it has been speculated
that Morgan is persona non grata with the Bureau.

6. Morgan continued active work in the Society of Former Agents
between 1955 and 1957. In 1957 he ran for the office of National
President of the Society. He was defeated in his bid for this office
and was very bitter about his defeat. For the past ten years he has
not attended more than two or three local meetings, and he does not
participate in Society activities. It was rumored that Morgan blamed
his defeat on the Bureau, stating that he was defeated because the
Bureau had black-listed him.

7. According to rumor Morgan moves in fairly high circles in
the District of Columbia. I believe he belongs to the Touchdown Club
and I also believe he belongs to one of the more exclusive country clubs
in the area. He drinks, but I have never seen him intoxicated. Other |
than the items mentioned above, I have never heard anything unfavorable
concerning him. There are a number of people in the Agency who knew
him and worked with him at the Bureau. I feel certain that(Erank Holmes)~
would know him fairly well, as well as Bill Harvey, Ron MacMillan,
Herman Horton and Glenn Fields. Lyon L. (Slug) Tyler, who has been
utilized by Central Cover)for a number of years, formerly worked for
Morgan in his law firm, but broke away from the firm because of some
disagreement. Tyler would probably know a great deal concerning
Morgan's personal habits. It should be remembered, however, that
because Morgan's law practice is primarily an administrative practice.
before the FCC, most of his business associates would be in the broad-
casting and news business.

7 June 1966

SUBJECT: MAHEU, Robert A.

1, Robert A. Mabeu, a personnel relations executive and
former F.B.1. Agent, has been utilized by the Office of Security
on many sensitive assignments since the early fifties. He has
also on several occasions been cleared for use by the DD/P in
various capacities. He does business.as Robert A.. Maheu, Asso-
ciates, and maintains offices in Washington, D.C., and Los
Angeles, California, where he is now residing.

2, It has come to our attention that the Senate Subcommittee
investigating wiretapping activities (Long Committee) has expressed
considerable interest in Maheu, He has never been asked to per-
form any technieal surveillance on our behalf.

3. The first inkling we had that the Long Committee was
interested in Maheu came to our attention through the OGC.
Mr. Lawrence Houston advised that Walter Yeagley, Assistant
Attorney General, Internal Security Division, had casually mentioned
to him that he had been advised by Raymond A. Taggart, an AID
o employee, that he may be called upon to testify before the Long
Committee regarding his activities while employed by Maheu (1954-55),

4, The only significant association the Agency had with Maheu .
during that period involved the struggle between two Greek industrial
giants, Stavros Niarchus and Aristottle Onassis. Maheu had been
retained as a trouble shooter for Niarchus. Onassis had just cone
cluded a pact with King Saud which would allow him to control approxi-
mately 90 percent of the ofl shiprnents out of Saudi Arabia. In con-
sumating the deal, he allegedly employed every trick in the book.

His achievement caused much consternation among the British,
German, and American interests. Niarchus also realized as a
result of this the balance of power and influence weighed heavily in

favor of Onassis in their own private battle. It was this mutual
concern of the United States and Niarchus that set the stage for

a joint venture. Niarchus supplied the money, personnel, and
documents; the Agency furnished the communications, courier
facilities, and direction in the form of our Commo channel, pouch

system, and the NEA Division's expertise and guidance.

S. Spyridon Catapodis, a Greek Broker, who had an ax to
grind against Onassis ae a result of being manipulated out of a
handsome commission he believed due him for his interceasion

with certain Saudi officials to secure oil rights for Onassis, spear-—

headed a campaign to publicize Onaseis' high-handed methods of
operation. This triggered off all sorts of international litigations
which erupted into suits and countersuits: by all parties concerned.
Of particular note was the case of Catapodis vs. Onassis, which
suit was filed in New York State. While Niarchus was being exam-
ined before trial by Onassis! attorney, he claimed Government
privilege in answering certain questions, This tact was challenged
by the attorney and pursued to the point that eventually it was re-
corded in the briefs filed by both the plaintiff and the defendent that
CIA was, in fact, the Government agency of interest. Close coor-
dination was maintained during this period with Justice and State.
At our request a representative of the U. &. Attorney's Office in
New York monitored all of the Hearings. Mr. Houston is intimately
familiar with the actions in this case, and copies of his memoranda
pertinent to it are contained in his files.

_ §. The Security file on Subject contains a Covert Security
Clearance issued 16 August 1954 at the request of NE/2, Att:
William Miller, for Maheu's use on Project TWIXT. Other inter-
ested DD/P personnel were identified as William F.:Rowland, <

ting Chief, NEA Division; George Prussing; Walter Snowden} and
Charles Woliamson. : .
6 .

7. Mr. Maheu was contacted to determine whether the Com-

mittee had been in touch with him. He stated he was not aware of

their interest in him. When the Taggart conversation was men-
tioned, he promptly replied that it must be the Onassis operation
they are looking into. He recalled that he had Onassis' New York
office "covered"! sometime during the period. John Frank, a

former staff employee, and then a private investigator, was en-
gaged to arrange for the coverage. Maheu could only identify the
technician by the name.of Leon. Presumably, this coverage was
done as a routine technique to keep the Niarchus interests informed .
on Onassis' movements. This was not initiated at the request of
any Agency component so far as our records indicate.

8. Subsequently, Maheu advised he had received 2 message

from one of the Committee's attorneys named Homme who wanted

to fly out to talk with him. Maheu fended him off by saying he was
tied up for the next several days. He then contacted his attorney,
Edward P. Morgan, ef Washington, D. C., and it was decided that
Morgan would meet him in St. Louis on 24 May for a conference.

'9, On Thursday morning, 26 May, Maheu called to advise
that he was at tha Madison Hotel, Washington, D. C., and was
anxious to talk with us. At his request it was arranged to have
Colonel Edwards accompany a member of this office to meet with
him. :

_ 10. Maheu opened the conversation by announcing that he had
been selected to be the star performer on a planned TV hearing ©
which is scheduled to open within the next few weeks. He went on
to give the basis for this statement tn the following detail.

When he first talked to Ed Morgan of the possibility
of his being subpoenaed, Morgan assured him that he
had nothing to be concerned about inasmuch as he was
a very close friend of Senator Long's personal attorney
who had considerable influence upon the Senator. The
lawyer resides in St, Louis, and he suggested that they
beth go out and solicit his assistance. After the presen-
tation of the facts, all three flew to Washington where
the lawyer secured an appointment with the Senator.
Mr. Bernard Fensterwald was in attendance at the
meeting. He identified himself as the Chief Attorney
for the Committee, According to Maheu, Fensterwald
made it clear that Maheu was their ace in the hole and
without him the Hearings would have no appeal. He
implied that Maheu's clients and their opposition added

up to a very attractive package. Such headliners
as Niarchus, Onassis, Dave McDonald, and Howard
Hughes are hard to come by. Fensterwald further
referred to Maheu as the type who employed the
technique of cutting the Government in just enough
on his touchy operations to permit him to hide behind
their akirts tf he were caught. It is the opinion of
the lawyer that, unless the Senator can be convinced
to the contrary, he will proceed with plans on schedule.

11, Maheu's most active account and, at this time, almost
exclusive client is Howard Hughes. in the past he did considerable
work for Dave McDonald, former president of the United Steel
Workers, So far as this office knows, the Agency never had any:
interest in either of these clients. However, it should be noted that
the IO Division was granted a Covert Security Approval on 4 June
1959 to approach Maheu and advise him of the Agency's interest in
international labor. Maheu claims he never became involved in any
"bugging" operation for either of thease accounts. .

12. It is not believed that Maheu wants or expects us to front.
for him in the Onassis tap matter. As mentioned previously, to our
knowledge this was not Agency sponsored. However, if exploited,
it would probably eventually lead to exposing our part in the Onassis/
Niarchus feud. As it is a matter of court record, it could not be
denied nor buried. Even though the details might be protected by
a declaration that it involved classified operational information, it
would set up a field day for the press and critice of the Agency. :

13, Mr. Maheu is presently furnishing cover for a DODS staff .
agent in his Washington, D. C., office. In this connection, two of
Maheu's employees have been cleared and witting. Other clearance
actions noted were: CSA granted FI/Plans, Cover Division on
30 August 1954 for use under LPHIDDEN; CSA issued to NE, Division
on 7 October 1959 for Maheu's use in the United States and(Jordan ) ag
inasmuch as he may be employed by(the King of 3 ordan| to handle
G ordanian public relations in the United States. 24

14. In 1958-59, Maheu was used by the FE Division in two
sensitive operations targeted against Sukarno. Mr. Allen Dulles
was aware and approved of these operations, Mr. Joseph Smith
who was then Chief/PMI, is knowledgeable of the actions.

15. While none of our interests in Maheu relate to wire~
tapping, it ia evident that the extensive and diversified use of him
makes us vulnerable to exploitation should he be interrogated in
depth regarding hie activities.

16, Mr. Maheu is maintaining a cooperative attitude and

has promised to do all in his power to protect the Agency from
embarrassment or compromise,

From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord,
Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy, of the Technical Division,
Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with
various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the .
Agency's Audio-C “termezsures Program.z4{They conceived and developed ©
a unique techr’, 4n (fluoroscopic scanning\which is considered to be
a major breakthruugh i the detection of clandestine microphones and
other devices targeted against the Agency. It gives the Agency for 24
the first time the capability tofdetect hidden technical listening de-

large” sums of money to develop in a variety of approaches. This tech--
nique will not only benefit the security of all Agency installations:
at home and abroad, but will be of utmost benefit to other agencies
in the community. This technique was met with wide acclaim by the
intelligence community and the Technical Security Countermeasures
Committee. >u

In experimenting with thellx-ray in combination with a fluoroscopic
screen,\these men showed this combination had distinct advantages in
terms time and effort over the considerably more expensive(i-ray 24

To further enhance the use of this equipment, these

These men have shown great ingenuity and resourcefulness
in the application and development of this audio-countermeasure.
technique. Through their further efforts in package design they
contributed significantly to the future clandestine use of this
technigue-on a world-wide basis. This technique provides the
Agency for the first time a procedure through which large in-
terior wall surfaces, room furnishings, and objects can be
rapidly scanned in “real time" in the search for hostile tech-
nical penetrations. This capability will significantly enhance
the security of all Agency installations. .

FROM : Mr. Robert J. Leonard

SUBJECT : TARASOFF, Anna
#131751 B-SB/2

GIST:

A special meeting was convened to consider the problem
of the prospective visit of Subject's father to the Russian
Embassy to obtain a visa. It was determined that he should
not be briefed in advance and that an army cover be provided
for Subject. “

DETAILS:

1. On 13 October 1960 the undersigned as representative
of the Office of Security met with Mr. Birch O'Neal, CI Staff;
T.K, Chalmers, CI/Projects; [Henry C. Woodward) CCG/DC; oF
Thornton W, Means, OCG/OCB and the Subject to discuss the
problem of a prospective trip to the Russian Embassy by the
Subject's father for a trip to Russia, __... : ++

2. Mr. O'Neal had Mrs. TARASOFF recount the details of
the situation, She said that several months ago her father
ANTHONY ADAMOVIEZ had indicated an interest in attempting
‘to locate his brother and sisters in Russia. He. sent
correspondence to his home town and received a reply from
his sister MARIYA KALNAK, c/o KALINOTSKIY, VZDEN SKIY RAYON,
MINSKAYA, U.S.S.R.. She stated that his brother IVANU
ULYANOVICHU ADOMOVICHU was also living. This correspondence
inspired ADAMOVIEZ with the desire to visit his brother and
ister in Russia wed his retirement. ADOMOVICHU, age 66,
——in good health, recently’retired from his job as a laborer

wtsir with American Steel and Wire Company and is now determined to
=. Br. isit Russia. Subject's mother has no intention of returning
o Russia.

3. Mrs, TARASOFF, on her return from a short vacation
isit to her husband BORIS D. TARASOFF, an Agency employee


Page 2:
of her father's intention to come to Washington to make
inquiry at the Russian Embassy in regard to his visit to
Russia. Subject's father wished Subject to accompany him
but she indicated that as a government employee she did
not want to go there,

Ob 4, Mrs, TARASOFF says that her oldest sister, Mrs.
[Sherry COMELLA* knows of her CIA employment and the necessity
Hot to divulgé this information. Subject stated that her
father and mother know only that she is a government employee,
They are not interested in the Agency or Department where
she or her husband is employed. Subject also advised that
although her landlady and Sears Roebuck Department Store know

her as CIA she is not aware that anyone else knows.

2. Mr. O'Neal asked what could be done about this

situation. Mr. Means said that Subject's husband is in
exico under Light state|cover but had previously been 32

backstopped firmly as a contract employee of the Department SC
of State, Escort Branch, Division of Language Services,\ He
said he would firm up this backstop so that in the event of x
inquiry at that |Division of. State\it would be confirmed that 22
he is in Mexico on an assignment. Mr. [Woodward \stated that 7
he would provide a U.S, Army | Translation Unit|\cover for >
Mrs. TARASOFF retroactive to her entrance on duty. The.
undersigned stated that he would conduct expedite credit
checks’on the Subject and’ Her husband to ascertgin whether or
not they Had been recorded as Agency employees.

6. It was agreed among the conferees that since the
father of Subject was unwitting of-Subject's CIA employment
he would not be specially briefed on what to answer in the
event that the question was asked in connection with his
VISA application. It was agreed that not knowing the specific
Department of Government he would have to consult his daughter
and then she could give the cover which had been prepared for
her. The undersigned pointed out the possibility that Subject's -
father might know of Subjects employment but it was agreed
that in view of his age and background it was very improbable
and that it would be better not to brief him specifically
on Subjects employment but to let the question be handled
naturally.

7. Subsequent to the meeting expedite credit checks on
the Subject and her-husband revealed. no record at either the
Credit Bureau or Stone's. It has subsequently been learned
that Subject's father had visited the Embassy and had been
asked to give a short history and the names of his chileren, €~
Subject was listed by her father in her maiden name,
Consequently no further difficulty is expected in this matter,
The Office of Security is to be kept advised of further
developments in this case by T. K, Chalmers, Subject's

Page 3:
1400000, .

Internal Intelligence Division
Specializes in exposing and controlling inside thefts that may

renge from employee pilferage, through embezzlement of thousands of
dollars, to highly valusble industrial secrets.

Central Clearing Division

Assists personnel end security directors to sereen quickly
the backgrounds of present end potential employees through the
messive files of The Wackenhut ‘Yorporation.

Retail Store Protection Division

designed to meet the client's specific needs.

tr: Services Division -

Provides specialized training programs for security, fire
fighting, investigative and other personnel of business organiza~
tions and professional groups.

Industrial Security Division

Provides the essential security services that are required by
all companies seeking or handling government classified contracts;
assists management in disaster and emergency planning.

Fire and Safety Division
Supplies ambulance services, first eid erews, Waekenhut fire-

men fully trained in the technical field of industrial and mni-
 Gipal fire fighting ‘and equipment, and safety surveys, systems,

and educational programs.
" Quard Forces Division

Selects, investigates, trains and supervises the uniformed

and plein-clothes guards who protect your operations; also provides

uniformed receptionists and guardettes; makes physical property

surveys to determine security requirements and. establishes security

systems and controls.

4. Mp. Wackenhut wants to expand abroad, in view of his
successful venture into Puerto Rico. However, he has no definite
plans as of the present and seemed to be seeking Grom CIA covert xt
sponsorship] for entry into areas of interest to us. He is pre-
pared to furnish personnel himself /or to permit integration of 2y
Agency nominees.{

5- It is not epparent to me that there is any significant
market for Wackenhut's services in foreign countries, except
possibly among American businesses with physical plants overseas.
The nature of these services, I would presume, would make rather .
difficult acquisition of the necessary occupational permits in
many countries. The potential for clandestine intelligence acti-
vities would be too apvious to host governments, and the emphasés


Page 4:
-3-

on former FRI personnel probably would enhance such suspicions,
particularly in Latin Anerica where 'FBI" means "intelligence"
since ites WW IT activities there.

6. CC8/NC on occasion receives requests for advice to busi+
ness orgenizations as to setting up security systems at overseas
installations. We recently referred a request of this type, :
involving 6 major oil company, to the Physical Security element of
the Security Office. Conceivably, the Agency might make some
arrangement to advise Wackenhut of such requests, providing our own
Security Office is satisfied as to Weckenhut's competence. (We >“
could then place an Agency representative, if desired, Am the teaxi2
dispatched overseas by Wackenhut} should his compeny successfully
secure the contract.

T- Wackenhut seid he would be willing to dispatch teams to
“set up personal security systems for foreign chtefs of state .
whom the Agency wants protected. He is amenable, in fact, to any
reasonable application of his capabilities to Agency problems.

He would be willing to negotiete financing in equitable propor~
tions in the event an overt operation, set up at Agency behest,
were not financially self-susteining.

8. Wackenhut impressed me as a clean-cut, energetic, ambitious
young business man who is obviously proud of what e 3 to be
a@ superior organization of its type. He is interes profits,
but it is my impression he is sincerely eager to do what he can to
essist the government and feels that CIA offers one possible oppor=

. -tunity. Incidentally, he appears somewhat younger in person then __

in the pictures appearing in the promotional material given the
writer. :

‘9. Copies of this memorandum are being furnished those Agency

- components which might have an interest in utilizing subject com-

peny. Ingzirles may be directed to the vriter.

September 1962 a Samuel G. WISE was Second Secretary of the American”

Department that it appeared that Bruce Frederick DAVIS, #352267, who
defected from the United States Army in Germany on 18 August 1960, had
not expatriated himself. DAVIS' case is very similar to that of
OSWALD; and he, like OSWALD, lived in the Soviet Union for two years

interested in him was "no longer interested". On 13 November 1953,
WISE was granted a CSA to permit his-use as a contract employee on

during an investigation of the latter for possible CIA employment” in 1952.
WISE, according to MUNSELI's landlady and social acquaintance in Washington,
D.C. during the period of about a year which ended in April 1952, was the
only person she knew by name with whom(MUNSELD.was friendly. According
to the informant, WISE was a student at Columbia University whose address
was 423 Furnald Hall. (MUNSELT) was Security disapproved for CIA employment
in June 1952 because of his chose association on a professional and social
basis, while attending Denver University from 19h6 + to 1951, with persons
of questionable loyality. In November 1954, CMONSELL was of interest to
project PFALLVE with reference to assignment to: ‘Dhahran, ‘Saudi wdi Arabia}
however, the interested office withdrew their request on hin, m, after
Security advised of the derogatory information regarding him.

9. WISE from 1951. to 1954 attended Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale,
New York, which was attacked by a Citizen's Group, which alleged Communist
influence in the school system. He had several questionable associates in

surrounding Blue Hole. with the Janaican goverment ownirg the balance. On
the beach facing the sea, Moore has tuilt acd operates a bar-restaurant which:
he calls the Teahouse of the blue Lazoon. Yais accounts for the couiusion

[Be Moore bas. just returned frow Viet Naa where be partici-

pated in the combat operations of the American Special Forces iu Viet Naa. after
he bad gone throush about eight munths of, training al the special Forces xchook

at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Sone understandin: ef Moore's personali
ontained frou reading au interview between bin and the mazazine U. =
World Report. which was published recently. and copy of which was lef‘ with
Varia, Further understandings aod irpressionz of Moore may te obtained from -
reading his previously published twok about Jack Youngblood. an American who
participated in the events leading to Castro's overthrow of Hattista.

b. In my opinion. Moore has a burning desire to be known |
as a tough, two-fisted, rip roarins soldier of fortune. He has participated
in real war in Viet Nai, and has received what is probably the best traiuing
in the world for guerilla fighters. namely. the C. &. Special Forces. Tais

includes training as a parachutist. ife is inclined to bray. and is probably .

inclined to interperate use of alcobul and wucen. and his judzenent of in-

- portant matters is probably immature. However. he definitely understands
and is experienced iu wuerilla fizhtiug, is experienced in military operations,

and rust surely understand military security.

c. He is definitely willing to help, but cannot contribute

cash directly; is willing to furnish the use of the cuest house on his property
for linited periods of time. Is willing to participate and aid in an operation

to land people on the sczth. coast of Cuba, tut is not willing to comit the ue
of his Property and facilities as a stagiug area for resupply in the future.

. d. Is willing to coue to Miasi, for conferences if bis
expenses are paid. - .

2. Site Evaluation

a. Blue Hole is an , excel lent bartor; protected avainst
all weather. and with six feet of waier at ine bar. Is surrounded by very
steep slopes, heavily wooded. Dock facilities are presently very meager,
but could be quickly and easily improved. \o fuel for a boat is avaiiabie .
at Blue Hole, and at Fort Antonio (ihe closest source). the fuel available .
is diese} fuel or autonotive gasoline; no marine white gasoline is available
auywhere ia the area. This is a nost significant factor in selecting a
suitable boat. —

b. The nearest source of food aud other supplies is Port
Autonio; Fred Barrett. manager of the Blue Lazoon Club. orders and hauls
supplies from Port Antovio constantly, aud could deliver whatever supplies
were desired. Firearms and explosives are not obtainable on the island.
They would have to be smuggled in illegally.

ce. A small station wagon is available for transportation,’
provided expenses are paid by users. :

3. Miscellaueous, Inforwatiou °

b. The S.S. Frangeline sails every two weeks fros “iaai i
direct to Port Antonio, and could be employed for the delivery of supplies and
even a toat to Hobin Moore.

c. Fred Barreti, manager of the bar-restaur‘nt. seera to i
woe be a verry capable wan. and for an additional 210 per week added to his regular
pay. would be quite willing to assist any operation, i

d. A‘Mr. Anihony Gason. a retired Britisi aray colonel, !

is the Jamaica representative 1 TROJAN boats, at a place called Turtle Cove, :

between Port Antonio and Blue dole. :

e. The immigration chief for Jaczica is a man ty the name:
of George Eubcuks. who is the forner chief of police at Port Antonio: Moore +
claims that they are very close personal friends.

d. Moore is acquainted with a ran by the name of Mike Hedges,
who is a nephew of Burke Hedges. the -\cerican who becars Cuba's actassador to
t Chile some years ago. ‘ike lives in Kingsiony and, if he is not a Sattista
: ae sympathizer. might prove to be a very valuable connection. The fazily is re-:
ported to be quite wealthy, and would establish an excellent cover. :

4. Operational Considerations : i

: a. In order to avoid the use of simnificent naes. I
Sustracited Moore to refer to Vanolo as George hinz. and the operatios of
landing him in Cuba would be referred to as Operatiouhiug, The cest likely
acheme seems to be to establish a suitable boat al Biue Hole, sith ike cover |
story to be that it belongs to \serican frieuds of Robin Moore. Hous~z is ~
available locally for a limited camber of Cutans, with “Moore being able to
accommodate up to six on his on property. The local boat captain. Leorge
Muuroe. could be employed as captain initially. to. train the Cuban crew in
the local warine conditions, as well as serving a5 at effectite sever. In >
ny opinion. it will rot be too difficult for persons to enter Jamaica without
difficulty, provided they know a certain ninizum amount of English. 3

we

I think a suitable locatizn could te found for redio .!
transnission and reception facilities on the nills surrounding Blue ‘ols. but —
this would have to be examined by someone skilled in radio techniques. Yateo
would be excellent. . . j

. ; In summary, I would say that Robin Moore aud his property ana!

' . buildinzs at Blue Hole would servé as an excellent tase of operatious. but that
: the boat necessary for the operation wuld have to be acquired and equipped

in the states and shipped down there, except for the renote pussiblility that;
a suitable boat could be found in Kinston. I think a headquarters could be;
established at small cost through Nwore's good offices, and IT think that Rud;
would te a good choice to coordinate the initial operations there. 3

2. Enclosed ysu will fini a list of attendees (Enclesure A)
to the Pugwash Conference held in ixmich, Gercany, in Aucsst, and
a set of questions (Enclosure 5) prepared by the ORPA ana
at our request. Since the original list of attendees ccntained
only the last nane and first jnitial of each US participant, we
had to mike sone educated guesses as to the true identities of
many of them. As a result, do net be surprised if some ceestion
why we felt they had attended. In many cases, however, there was
no question as_to the true identity of the scurce.

2. ORPA has been quite plesscd with the renorting ©
their previous iz. 4254 result, tney have mere an
extra e:tort to write even more thought proveking require-exts.
We feel that the enclosed questicns are the best we have sent out '

RELEVANCE OR NON-RELEVANCE TO OSWALD & JFK ASSASSINATION:

Neither the information or time frame is relevant. See Summary below.

REASON OR ASSUMED REASON FOR INCLUSION IN THIS COLLECTION.

A review of the HSCA volumes did not surface an "Abram" Chayes but an "Abraham" Chayes, a legal
advisor to the State Department, who maintained that at the time Oswald received his visa to enter Russia
from the Soviet Embassy in Helsinik, normally at least 1 week would elapse between the time of a tourist's
application and the issuance of a vias. It would appear that Abram and Abraham are not identical to each
other. Betty Lichtenfeld of the HSCA reviewed the file on 17 August 1978.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION WITHIN FILE:

Harvard Law School professor who attended a Pugwash Conference in Munich in 1977.

ACTION RIQUIRLD REFLRLNCES

For your tntormatién

Action:

_ Ref : UFGA-5897,' dated 25 September 1962
1. Forwarded under separate cover as Attachment A is a copy
of the original, and translation of a letter from the National
Coordination Committee of AMSPELL in Cuba dated 28 November 1962,
This letter was obtained through the AMBLEAK courier intercept
channel prior to delivery to AMSPELL on 4 December 1962,

2. The communication is of interest since it contains the
most recent report or AMSPELL underground activities and particularly
claims commitment of a guerrilla warfare effort in two provinces,
It also refers to the infiltration. of AMHINT-58 as still feasible,
and confirms the arrest of AMHINT-{10, who is described as a prisoner

in Block 9 at La Cabana Prison, vi

3, Attachment 'B is a report of underground financing for
October 1962 and is/the first detailed analysis of Cuban finances
ever received by IMWAVE, This report was compiled by "Cuca" (National
Coordinator for Civil Res{stance identified in Para 5 of Reference).
It should be noted that the total of $9,129.67 Cuban pesos as mon-
thly maintenance is [for the "Resistance" only and does not include
the "National Military Committee" expenses for the month,

money expressed in Attachment A letter was soon thereafter satisfied.
when JMWAVE funded AMSPELL with $5,000 for exchange of $40,000 .
Cuban pesos and this was transmitted via Jocal deposit and credit

Dear Brothers:
+ IT hope from my, call (LD telephone) yesterday you are aware of
how desperate we are,. financially, ‘The week before last, I went to

Las Villas and I want you to know that the DRE flag has now been raised

in the Free Territory in Cuba. small guerrilla (group) well supplied,
is now’ representing us “in the North Zone of Las Villas. And the
guerrilla banda tn Matanzas to whom we have offered some support will
no doubt come into our organization if assured a little more help from
the DRE. . : i

We have been working on the total reorganization and if wo
cannot claim complete success it ts because if our limited resources,
Propaganda, although|on a small scale, is functioning well, I am
enclosing a copy of our last issue of Trinchera and examples of the
seals we are producing ‘in homes of Pre- University members. These

are now appearing in 'public places. As you can see there is a willing- |

ness to work and with a little material support a great deal of eff-
ective work could be forthcoming.

I cannot understand yet, the delay in sending money. You remember
how you witnessed our| needs that day in Varadero, Luis? We only
had a few centavos tn! capital? Well, that is the way we are now,
We have asked a small'local loan and after that must travel to Las
Villas for a loan from the Provincial (Committee) there, since they

i

seem to have money. I hope upon receipt of this (etter), if you have

not sent money, you will do so immediately,

Concerning the travel of Angel (AMHINT-58 infiltration), advise
- |
me as soon as this can be arranged so that we can check the security:

aspects here, Our Purpose is @ to be organized to facilitate the work

of the infiltrees since it has been our unfortunate experience that
if those infiltrating must move about, the exposure to arrest is
greater, ; :

Write at the first opportuni ty and advise me of the planning sq

that we may work toward that end. Greetings from Marivi, Maggie, -

1. SUMMARY, The Reference A. ANMSPELL exhibit toured six
Latin American countries during a five-month period, February-June
1964. With the exception of Guayaquil and La Paz -- where excel-
lent results were achieved -- the tour was only moderately success-
ful, and must be classified a failure in Quito, Santiago and
Montevideo. According to ANSPELL, the total number of persons who
viewed the exhibit was 6,720: Another 2,792 persons reportedly
attended conferences at which the AMSPELL team gave talks on the
Reference A. exhibit and the dangers..and.weaknesses.of-Castro- -~
Communism....Publicity was given the exhibit by 34 newspapers (47
items), 30 radio stations, and six television stations. AMSPELL
estimated the TV audtence at 1,300,000. Sample clippings are
enclesed under separate cover. Reports from WH stations and the
WAVE debriefing of the AMSPELL team lead us to conclude that the
tour was. a moderate success that could have been much better if
if had been better organized and if the ANSPELL team had had more
experience. (On balance) we believe the tour was well worth the = _
approximately $12,000.00 KUBARK paid out. We do not, however, .
believe it should be repeated in-the foreseeable future in view
of the relative inexperience shown by the AMSPELL team on the
recent tour and the many difficulties encountered in trying to
organize the exhibit in the various cities.

2. COLOXBIA. ns

sete a, Bogota The ANSPELL team arrived in Bogota on 12 February
1964. but were unable to make contact with the local AXSPELL/AMBARB :
contact until the uext day. They were unable to get adequate advance
publicity and had trouble finding space for the exhibit, About 200,
‘persons attended the exhibit, and AMSPELL conferences were attended by
approximately 485° persons. HLBA-G911Ircported{ G1 N -9's observations
on the local reaction to the tour, which he judged to be indifforent,
The AMSPELL teaii freely. admitted to WAVE that the Bogota operation was
something less than successful, but ‘blamed the lack of advance prepara~
tions and the existence Of an unfriendly press for their failure, It
should also be noted that the. AMSPELL team was not on the best of terms
with some of the™2ocal Cubans, and this fact probably had a good deal

to do with the poor showing. . .

b. Medellin, The showing in Medellin was better. than in
Bogota, ‘The press “was lukewarm but the director of the Caracol radio
station gave them’ considerable publicity, and they were able to hold
the exhibit in a‘central spot in the city. About 400 persons visited
the exhibit over ‘a period of three days, and 850 persons attended con-.

ferences given by the team, .

t : .

c. Cali, The team received wood advance press pYay in Cali,
: which was perhaps one reason for the fact that the local Communist party
was ‘also well prepared for their arrival, On the very first morning
of the exhibit, a large crowd of Communists tried to enter tne exhibit
with the obvious intention of starting trouble, and when they were as
locked out began to throw rocks and “stinkbombs" into the exhibit hall, ©
The incident provided considerable publicity for. AMSPBLL, as reported
in BOGO 4332. A total of 100 persons attended the exhibit. The AMSPELL
team claimed tnat the Communists were very strong in Cali and that work—
ing there was like swimming upstream, ,

3. ECUADOR.

a. Quito. The team arrived in Quito on 25 March, after spend-
ing several days in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain visas for Peru.
QUIT 5867 reported the AMSPELL team's personality clashes with the
local AMBARBs. and the consequent poor performance by the AMSPELL team,
who complained of the absence of police protection, adequate facilities
for the exhibit, etc., and departed just two days later on the 27th.
One member remained in Bogota to hold conferences, attended by 335. -
persons, Whiie not accepting the blame for this fiasco, the AMSPELL —
team generally corroborated tne above story in their debriefing by WAVE.
After such incidents as reported in QUIT 5867, we are reluctant to
recommend any future tours, .

b. Guayaquil, The AMSPELL team considered Guayaquil their
most successful operation, an opinion seconded by Guayaquil base. who
termed it. a “resounding success." (See QUIT 5867 and HEGA 2900). The
exhibit received front page coverage in "El Universo” and "El Telegrafo"
and they were given a half hour on a major TV station, An estimated
total of 1,200 persons visited the exhibit, and the team spoke before
40 members of a local group, Frente de Defensa Nacional, an

4, Santiago, Chile.

The AMSPELL team arrived in Sant tago on 3 March to coincide
with the opening of the Latin American Youth Congress (LAYC), The
Santiago operation was a complete loss because Chilean customs authori-
ties would not release the exhibit during the congress and the AMSPELL
team was unable to obtain space of any kind to hold conferences due to
competition from the congress for space. (See SAGO 6577). The AMSPELL
team had been counting on a contact in the Catholic University, Fernando u
SANHUESA, |to facilitate their activities but (SANHUESA}t ld them that
the LAYC was a failure from the Communist side and that°the AMSPELL teas
could contribute more by remaining quiet than. by actively propagandizing

was that ‘the AMSPELL team did nothing... An amateurish plan to kidnap.a

_ La Paz, Bolivia.
. yi.) The AMSPELL team arrived in La Paz on 17 March
difficulty in obtaining space Were finally able to open the exhibit

in Club La Paz on 21 March, As noted in LAPA 5550, exhibits and con=
ferences wore held in various locations ‘in tlio city, with the closing
performance on-25 March at the Scala Theater hosted by the Venozuelan

“The exhibit received excellent coverage in all four of the-

Paz newspapers and. the three largest radio stations carried
LL conferences, Despite the excellent publicity, a total of only
‘600 persons visited the exhibit in La Paz. According to AMSPELL, this
was due to Bolivian preoccupation with Such things as a national day ‘to

demand a passage to the’ sea for Bolivia which stopped all traffic and-
communication, - , :

6. Argentina, . t
a. Buenos. Aires, Tho AMSPELL team arrived in Buenos Aires on
27 March during Holy Week... In addition to t

With the help of the ‘Chamber of Commerce, the. exhibit finally opened on;
6 April in Chamber of Commerce offices on Leandro Allem street, An
estimated 1,200 persons visited the exhibit during a four-day period,
and good. publicity was. also obtained in the La: Prensa and La Razon
‘Newspapers, The AMSPELL &roup also obtained 10 minutes on Panorana
Mundial, Channel 7 TV, as part of a 30-minute program on Cuba and the
overthrow of Goulart in Brazil, According to AMSPELL, the Panorama.
program is rated as laving 500,000 viewors, The AMSPELL team also held.
four conferences. before small groups of Rotarians and university student:
“which were attended by a total of. 100 persons

b. Rosario, ‘The AMSPELL team arrived in Rosario on 11 April
and opened the exhibit on 15 April, after the customary difficulties
of finding a site due to the lack of advance preparations, The local
chamber of commerce finally came through with an excellent Sito, the
"Galeria Libertad", in the center of town, A total of 2,000 persons
visited the exhibit during the three days it was open, Locat news— -
Papers (La Cronica, La Tribuna, La Capital) gave good publicity to the
tour, The local radio stations gave spot announcements of the exhibit .
but did not give any additional publicity, :

€. Cordoba, The AMSPELL team made a hurried trip to Cordoba,
where they were able to show the exhibit to an estimated 600 persons
during a three-day stay, 20-23 April. The local chamber of commerce
Was again very helpful in arranging for Space for the exhibit and obtain
ing local Press publicity. Good press coverage was obtained in Los
Principios and Cordoba, : ™

7. Montevideo, Uruguay. The AMSPELL team reported that Montevideo
was the worst performance of the entire tour, with only twenty persons
attending the exhibit, They arrived on: 26 April and after unsuccess—
fully attempting to obtain a site in a central location, felt obliged
to accept space in the Catholic Club, considered a center of reaction
by many Uruguayans and remote from the main thoroughfares, Despite
the poor reception and the lack. of g00d local contacts, a fair amount
of Publicity was obtained in the local press and the AMSPELL team had
a one~hour show on the local TV channel 10,

@arly arrival caught their local contacts unprepared amd it was not
‘until 16 May that the exhibit opened,. Excellent support was provided
by station assets and widespread publicity was given to the event,
However, the exhibit was located in-a relatively remote spot and onl
300. persons attended the exhibit, according to AMSPELL. (Tho Statio
estimate was 400-500), Another 140 persons attonded ANSPELL con-

by the WAVE debriefing of the AMSPELL toam, describes the typical
experience of the AMSPELL team throughout the. tour with the exception.
that local support was not always as effective as in Caracas,

‘MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Ramparts:. John Garrett UNDERHILL Jrt,
: Samuel George CUMMINGS, and

INTERARMCO —

1. Ramparts of June 1967, Vol. 5, No. 12, pp- 28-29, contains:
the following passages about Subjects: eo

_. "The day after the assassination, Gary Unde rhill left
Washington in a hurry. Late in the evening he: showed up
at the home of friends in New Jersey. .He was very agitated.
A small clique within the CIA was responsible for the as~
sassination, he confided, and he was afraid for his life and
probably would have to leave the country. Less than six

_. months later Underhill was found shot to death in his

~ .Washington apartment. The coroner ruled it suicide.

"J, Garrett Underhill had been an intelligence agent
during World War Ii and was a ¥ecognized authority on limi-
ted warfare and small arms. A resea rcher and writer on
military affairs, he was ona first -name basis with many of

“the top brass in the Pentagon. He was also on intimate terms
with a number of high-ranking CIA officials--he was one of

" the Agency's ‘un-people' who perform special assignments.
At one time he had been a friend of Samuel Cummings of
Intérarmco, the arms broker that numbers among its cus-
‘tomers the CIA and, ironically, Klein's Sporting Goods of
Chicago, from whence fsic/ the mail-order Carcano alleg-.
edly was purchased by Oswald. °

“The friends whom Underhill visited say he was sober
but badly shook. They say he attributed the Kennedy
murder to a CLA clique which was carrying on a lucrative
racket in gun-running, narcotics and other contraband,

_and manipulating political intrigue to serve its own ends.
Kennedy supposedly got wind that soniething was going oa
and was killed beforé he could "blow the whistle on it’.
‘Although the friends had always known Underhill to be
.. \petfectly rationaland objective, they at first didn't take
‘his account seriously. ‘I think the main reason was,"
‘explains the husband, “that we couldn't believe that the
. CIA could contain a corrupt element every bit as ruth-
* lesé--and more efficient--as the mafia.*

"Phe verdict of suicide in Underhill's death is by no
* means convincing. His body was found by a writing
:. collaborator, Asher Brynes of the New Republic. He .
chad been shot behind the left car, and an automatic pistol
- was under his left side. Odd, says Brynes, because
Underhill was right-handed, Brynes thinks the pistol
was fitted with a‘silencer, and occupants of the apartment
building couid not recall hearing a shot. Underhill obvi-
ously had been dead several days.

. “Garry Underhill's chilling story is hardly implausible. :
_As a spy apparatus the CIA is honeycombed with sel{-
contained cliques operating without any real central control... Pad

2. A check of Agency records has yielded the following, information

about John Garrett UNDERHILL Jr.
a. DPOB: 7 August 1915, Brooklyn. |

‘ show that there was interest by the New York office of

OO, Contacts Division, in using Subject as a contact for
foreign intelligence. Name checks were conducted with
various military. members of the intelligence community,
but these yielded insufficient information, and OO was
advised that contact should be developed with caution, on
a limited basis, and that Subject was not to receive in-
formation classified higher than confidential.

gy On 12 March 1957 national agency checks were

again. requested on Subject because of interest by the
- Office of Security. . :

h. A UP article of unknown date cites an article written
by UNDERHILL for Esquire. The article-described the U.S.
Army as shockingly weak. The UP piece stated that
UNDERHILL served in military intelligence in World War
U1 and Korea. UNDERHILL said that he had served as a con- -

sultant /probably in 1956/ to an Army coordinating group.

f. A.1957 cable states that a business man in.
Panama, an Agency source, knew CUMMINGS to
be providing information to the FBI and also. knew
him to be "careful about keeping the appropriate’
U.S, Government agencies informed of his deals."

Cane g-. Inearly 1958 CUMMINGS assumed sole af)
ee ownership of International Armament Corp. and | /:
“vot. Interarmco. (An Agency audit established the ad
net worth of these companies as $219, 000, 00;
CUMMINGS bought them with a non-interest bearing
promissory note in the amount of $100, 000," payable
in four annual ‘installments of $25,000, and certain .
items of inventory which had a cost value of $67, 000
and a market.value of $250,000. These items were ay)
to remain the property of CIA, and their cost was
to be returned to the Agency after they were sold.

kh. On 28 June 1961 the West.German publication
Dér Spiegel reported that CUMMINGS had been em-
ployed by CIA as an arms expert during the Korean’
War and. that he had cooperated with CIA in' “supplying.
arme to various trouble spots". .

for Interarmco, contact with him waa established by
the WH Division. This contact was taken over by
C/CI/SPG im September 1954. (CUMMINGS knows *
him onily by alias.) This contact is still maintaineds:
Cntil recently the principal purpose was to dispose ™
of arms,(and CLA made.a sizeable profit on these. 2
transactions.) The current contact is not operational.—~
It is not based ona project, and no payrrients are
made to” CUMMINGS. who volunteers information re-
sulting from his extensive travels and high-level
contacts. An operational clearance for CUMMINGS!

i On 4 January 1962 the Rome periodical Vie Nuove
stated that. CUMMINGS was hired by CIA as-an expert
in arms and ballistics.

~ k in’December 1962 the Office of Security recom-

mended ‘against his use by Domestic Contact Service as
a source, and in December 1964 the CI. Staff advised that :
it had no operational intereet in Subject. (Comment; As

wae ‘noted above, this statement is correct, because
Subject's activity is ‘not ‘directed by the © Agency. He ..

‘ volunteers information: })

dated I June 1965, stated that at that time there was
"no record of a current (operational interest in Subject. "

the BND (West German foreign intelligence service) °
for a year or more, that he had been givea require-
ments by the. BND, and that these included lists of
Soviet and Bloc arma for procurement. It was also
reported: that he showed a BND representative a copy
of a purchase order for the procurement of a Soviet

| T-54-tank, the order having originated with DIA.

BND officials have often stated that CUMMINGS isa
CIA agent.

had a ring of truth in it, or at least appealed to the masses, That
some of the’ contacts with young girls who served as “brigadistas"

ACTION: PY

“The following information was provided by Francisco Luis Rodrigues
Gonzales (CC-1169), a Cuban refuges. who. arrived in’ Spain in early auguat
1962 and-had been active in the Revolutionary. Student. Directorate, ane. .
anti-Government resistance group, while in Cuba. iy

te
« Source has deen opposed to the Castro regine ever since: ithe. deteation of
“Diaz Lanz ‘in May 1959, and was involvod in sabotage activity with,
Revolutionary Student Directorate. Hie immediate supervisor was} Rigel OG
;Fontanills}. known as "Charles" in clandestine ciroles. Alberto X ler,
tlio Teade¥ of this group, arrived clandestinely in Cuba in Qotobor or
November 1960 and began to organize the various groups of,Uirectorate to
bring about an insurrection in the Si iaestra area, in Oriente Frovince.
‘These groups were mainly from tha provi Ged of Las Villas ‘and Havana, and
received orders to unite with 1 Xuller who was already in the Siepra aestra.
The men went there in small groups, and had the seminary in the Santuario
del Cobre as their destination. Once in that spot, they received final
instructions and military equipment. Souroe's group, whioh vonsisted of two
oarloads, entered the Sierra Maestra through Bayamo. Source was. riding in
the. first car. When they arrived on thy outskirta of Bayamo, source's car
wag: stopped by the militia, but the car way ayiowed tO pass without any
check. ‘A few minutes later they realized that they were bein: rollowed and
tried to escape. An alarm and shots went up, and they were finally captured
and taken prisoner. Tne seoond oar, which was following close behind them
and was warned by the shcts, was able to escape. :

. . .
‘he prisoners were taxen first to G-2 Headquarters in Santiago de Cuba and
later to the Boniato Prison, where they were interrogated by the G=2.-
There were two American prisoners thera, and althouzsh source did not know
their names, he said that they were from the Cuantanamo.Naval Base.

Muller was taken prisoner a faw days later (shortly after the ill-fated
invasion of Flaya Giron). No arms were taken from hia when ne wae arrested.
Had this insurrection been successful, about ‘1,000 men would ‘have risen MPs

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

d. Of the Buller group, which was called the "127", about ® prisoners wore
taken, five of whon, including source, were sot free. One of these was
an infiltrator oslled Flores, whom no one trusted since they knew that,
be wav not "one of the group.". Another of these was Rolando Valdes,
‘Dtiolf who is now in prigon in the ‘Fortaleza de la Cabasia serving a nine+~
yoar. sentence. He was captured trying to escape in a cer celonging to a
militiaman and wearin, a militia uniform. He defended himself bravely, but
received five bullet wounds which incapacitated him. The other two who
wero released were Eduardo Diaz Lanz and Jorge Crus Pejia, a sergeant in
the Rebel Amy who was with Castro in the Sierra. Tho letter hud actually
not been involved in the groups Source thought that he (source) and Diaz
Lanz were released so that they mi¢ht be followed and lead the Government
.to other groups and individuals in Havana who might be involved in
resistance activitys Source had deen -in prison six months tefore being
released, and one thing which he could not explain was that on the: ‘paper
that he wae given which indicated. his release, no mention was nade of any

Sentence or penalty.

On several occasions, Muller had been subjected to false execution

procédures, with the purpose of trying to make him talk, out he did not.
- weaken. During the trial, "everyone remained rirm," and zource was told
that. Muller wae very brave in his pronouncements against the Hegime and,
at every moment, abided by his principles. He presented a very. brilliant

self-defense.

f. When source was in the Boniato prieon, he shared a cell with a Captain
An{bal Rodr{uez, who belonged to the AHR. Thie officer, along with other
rebel officers and soldiers, had’ staged an upriving in inlas, in Oriente
Province. Later he was sentenced to deati and shot.

During his last days in Cuba, source avoided all revolutionary activity,
since he wanted to leave Cuba more than anything else. However he knew
that the various resistance groups worked hard, oarrying out a great deal -
of independent sabotage activity, although there was ‘not mich coordination
among the various: movements. One movement whioh had-a. large membership,
especially in Orients Provincey:was the 30-11. This group was planning to
launch an insurrection in Pinar del Rfo in January 1962, but they could
‘not carry it’out-since the repression in the area was so greate .

Be

\ be Hans, a momber of the Revolutionary Student Directorate, was recently
taken prisoner, and it seemed that he was tortured a yreat deal and
talked. As a result. of thie, a house in ajay, in Havana Province, was
seized and arms and gelatina wera found. The owners of the aouse and other

“persons yere arrested.

SOURCE: Cuban Goverment Sfficial (F).
Appraisal of & tt 3

: 1. Contrary to the reports which are issued by the Cuban Goverment, the

H , financial status of the Cuban econony is rapidly deteriorating and

! beconing a serious problem. During July 1959 an advisor to Prime.

i Minister Fidel CASTRO Rua, warned him to proceed more alowly with the
agrarian reform, because the Cuban treasury was running short of funds.

. It was pointed out that 57 sygar mils were barkrupt and had not paid

>. ' the plantation owners for the 1959 sugar crop. CASTRO waa told that

if the reckless confiscation of agricultural properties ccntinued, the

Cuban Goverment would become obligated to assume even more debts in

order to alleviate the hunger of farz workera.l

2. Another drain va the econony is goverment subsidies, For example,
the danco de Desarrollo Economico y Social (BANDES, Social and
Economio Development Bank) coutrols about U.S. $400 nillion in
properties ani investments such as the Compwiia Cubana de Aviacion
(Cuban Airline Company). The companies have been caught in the
presont contraction of capital and cannot survive without government
subsidies, The subsidies paid by BAND=S amount to U. S. $8 million
a month, and this is only one exemple of the many payments vhich are
draining toe Cuban ‘treasury .2 : .-

Eleld Corments.

1. Freomthe-reports -which-have-been-received {t appears that there is
grvwing unemployment of farm yorkers. This is the “dead season*--
the period between sugar cens harvests—-but it is reported that
most plantation. owners and ranchers are fearful of confiscation of

: their properties for the agrarian-reform program)/and consequsntly

: are doing very little in the way of maintenance vork. The latter

i Provided tat ase @ marginal field of employment, and this is now
denied to the agricultural workers, However, spite of this
warring, the dgrarian-reform program has not been aloved. In
fact, it seems to have been intensified,

2. ae Goures thought that nothing could stop CASTRO Jn his determination : og 1
UO to proceed vith the agrarian reform progran a3 fast as possible. Since i 7
the biggest obstacle to carrying out this program is the lack of money, i
tho ‘hource was of the opinion that CASTR) vould do anything to obtain . {
this money aai might even confiscate bank accounts and moneys and nego-

tiable irstrusents held in safety deposit doxes. Carrying this one :

step furthar, the yource thought such cowfiscatory tactics could only, - ;
be a teaporary eating dovice and that eventually it would be necessary |
for CASTIO te obtain a large lean fro: another country. Fe speculated oe
that this vould mean either the United States or the Suviet Union, and . :
feared that if it vere the lattery/it would rean the end of friendly

‘relations with the United States. In respect to CASTRO's possible _ OS 4
need for a loan, another, fairly reliable, source reported on 18 August : .
1959 that Casta) was trying te obtain a W,000,000-peso loan from dost f

banks.

ACTION REQUIRED BCALENTS,

REF: UFGA-%425 dated 19 June 1962

‘1. SUMMARY: In the period since ref prorress report
AMDENIN=-1 has been primarily enraged in keeping his fences mended
with the various exile croups inthe area in anticipation of. mov-.
ing inta.a.pesition in the AMBUD-l-oreanfzation in which he will
-a_respensible for coordinating ‘the seledtion of paramilitary =~
dates. From these groups, In additidn to this he has prepared

a nuater of reports providing backeround information,-and on cur-
_ rent activities in the local PR®UMEN community and mounting .
- Operation Antonico I, an effort to establish contact with PBRUMEN
"fishermen thru his own fisherman contacts. Details follow: .

OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

2. In response to a Station request subject provided an
estimate of the current situation in PBRUMEN. This report
stressed the points that the farmers and the fishermen. in PBRUMEN
are the most willing and capable of providing support to resis-
tance activities as a result of their having suffered the “most at
the hands of the current administration after being largely —
responsible for its obtaining power, He also provided a general
strategic plan of Oriente Province in which he defined the main
-areas in which guerrilla elements can survive and how they can be
reached fron coastal resupply points. His ability to do ‘this is
based upon his being a native of the area and one who has been
primarily interested in its geography due to his former large.

“agriculture holdings there. _ aaa

3._ He has had one meeting with AMBUD-1 for the purpose of
maintaining contact. His main question to AMBUD-1 “was with regard
_ to the latter's ability to actually control the people on his staff.
He was disappointed by the reply which though positive could not be’
supported with an example of where AMBUD-1 had actually brought ~~

about the dismissal of anvone who had proved to be ineffective,
AMDENIM-1 is a rood friend of AMBUNeL as a result of his father's
long standing relationship with hin, but at this point has very

, little respect fer him as a result of, as he says, AMBUD-1's

\ failure to actually make his orranization into an effective body

| and to enpare in activities which actually detract fron the success

of the current PSRUMEN reaine. It remains that he is willine

Following his belief that the most incortant job at hand

_ is the development and maintenance of maritime reception points

> along the north coast of PBRUMEN, AMDENIM-1 has devoted considerable
.. time to readying assets anong his exiled fisherman friends to make

PBRUMEN. The foundation for this activity is quite. tenuous asa
‘result of a variety of factors which make it difficult. to arrance
Sea rendezvouses in the absence of radio contact, - Several i
have been made to the Anguila Key area for this purpose, the last :
OF which’was su ported.by_KUBARK and was called Operation Antonico
i,.This attempt was unsuccessfub dua tothe failure of the inside
contact to appear, It developed that the woman and child who vere
to be exfiltrated on this operation appeared in the JMWAVE area
two days later, having obtained permission to leave PBRUMEN by air,
They carried the message that someone had-stolen theport chief's

' personal boat as a result of which the inside contact Was unable
to depart on schedule due to the implementation of te

icti Sh

¢. $325, was siven to AMPENI%~1 in support of Operation a
Antonico I, which operation is described under Para- fa
praph 4, :

7, INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION: ANDENIM+1 has provided a number
of memoranda on develoonents within the various exile eroups in the
JMWAVE area, none of which qualify as intellipenge inforzation but
all of which Contribute to the Station's bétter understandine oF
She local politics, Specifically, he haS provided info on the

“political beliefs and backrround of most of the PBRUMEN exiled labor
leaders and the activities of the Bequer prour. He has also teen :
helpful in clarifving the picture as to the ;novements within the
UR at this time while the Station is trying to determine how best
to organize this group in order to be able to take over its more
‘worthwhile features without becoming unduly committed to giving
it special -prominence in the exile community. He is being counted.
on to help bring the UR into the AMBUD-1 orpanization as a means
of creating the appearance of greater unity among the exile

community. .

8. COMMENTS AND FLANS: While no spectacular achievements are

resulting from AMDENIM-l's efforts at this point he is steadil
becoming more and more susceptible to KUBARK control and more

“pro stona 3 efforts. A recent example 18 the critique he
gave his fishermen for not realizing more information out of the
refugees they met at Anguila Key while waiting for their inside
contact, They had failed to adequately debrief two young men, who
had succeeded in surviving in PBRUMEN for over two. months on their
own, on the basis that they were too young to be knowledgeable. .
As it turned out the two refugees had used the cover-of’ 2
salesmen and had been able to travel from Havana to. $a itiago de
Cuba without being stopped once. On learning of this’, AMDENIM-1
was reminded of a good cover he has heard about, namély fighting

MEMORANBOM FOR THE RECORD:
. : ; SUBJECT: Bebriefing ef Edward G. Tichbern(P)

1. Edward G.Tichborn(P) arrived in Washington from his. trip to Cubs: during
the night of 31 Jamary 1960/. "e was debrhefed at the Rotel Statler from about
1000 to 1530 hours on 1 February. Those present atthe debriefing were Messrs.

03 (Phil Toowe) and Charles Penney frem W® Division, Me ‘Alexander Hunter) PP/EAD, and
ie Undersigned, This debriefing was very interesting and resulted ink a good
deal of pertinent information. The three and a half reels of tape derived free
therefrom are now being transcribed by this effice. Some of the more salient

points are noted below,
x

2. Some of the operational information and suggestions offered by Tichborn
are the following:

a. There appears to be little chance of a coalition ef the opposition
groups at this time or in the near future since they are not well organized
and each group xank would want to be the leader of such an effort. Also,
according to the muabers of the orposition to whom Tichborn talked, it is
the general consensus cf opinion that Fidel Castro is in no danger of loosing
his grip or the devotion of his followérsx for some time to come.

b. Fidel Castro seems to becone most xt upset and almost paniced ty . t
defections. Possessing a "Messiah-type complex" he cannot bear the thought
of someone leaving the fold. Rather than to let such defections pass on
unnoticed, he feels compélled to give rsasons and rake excuses. This then
‘blows hhe matter up perhaps out of proportion and quickly becomes a matter
of public knowledge. Tichborn feels that the inducement of defecticns could
perhaps have more effect on Castro than any other single, rational action ve
might undertake. .

¢, There appears to be a relatively long-standing schism between the
brothers Fidel and Raoul Castro. Raoul is the mone cold individual. As an
example, Fidel once ordered some '400 prisoners to be returned safely to their
hopes, but Racul had a number of.,them killed. The general feeling in Cuba is
ghet Fidel is not a Commmist, but that Raoul is undoubtedly at least a
fellow-traveller. Developing or exploiting this schism could therefore, be
operationally advantageous. (The fact that they are brothers would probably
have little effect on Fidel who Ras already reduced Ktxxurmt the land holdings
of his mother and another brother in conformity with the agrarian refor2
program and who jailed his sister, and fired a Minister, over 2 shake-dowm
on an insurance deal.) oo .
3. Of special operatioral interest were severs) individuals Tichborn .
mentioned who might have some influence on Fidel Castro and hence might be of

08

SN ee me eh Len Ne glee ile te aa lh Oa Lb aeanea STA

Shen

operational interest. They are:

- a. Pather (Padre) Alberto de Castro: he is a Jesuit priest presently
located in Caracas, Venezuela, who had been a teacher of Fidel Castro during
his youth. Castro was in Venezuela and saw Father de Castro there during
: ‘ which time the latter criticized Fidel for some of his actions. In spite of
“ _the fat that this remonstration occured in front of some of Fidel's men,
: _ and they leterthe latter treated “him with great respect. It was felt by Tichbern's source’
. Chatted.alone of this information, and by Tishborn, that Father de Castro undoubted
for an hour. has some-influence over Castro. Tichborn suggested that it would be of value to
determine whether or not Fidel has cny regular contact with Father de Castro
and.if so,what oferational potential he might have.

b.. Merb Mathews: he is a journalist with the R.Y.Times and was the only
American newspaperman covering the Castro story prior to his final success.
While Tichborn was in Vuba, a front page article ge appeared in Revolucion
(the regime's press-spokesman) on Mathews. It was a sort of editorial and
praised Mathews as a "real man" and one who understocd the revolution and
its aims, Tichborn feels that it might be to our advantage to get into
contact with Mathews since he appears to have the confidence of the

administration.

ee -
c. Professomiosco! Subject is on the faculty of the Universidad de
Villanueva and is a contemporary of Fidel Castro. They were claesmates and
both were debators although according to Rosco, Castro did not make the
: Debating. Society ‘of which he(Rosco) was the presidentCnce after the

revolution, Rosco attended a_sppech Castro made and after the oration, the

. TS latter asked Rosco wht he thought cf it. Upon hearing some criticism, he wanted
to kmow how it could: have been improved. Since Castro was leaving for .

itt « Venezuela ‘and the United States he asked Rosco to accompany him in order that
they could discuss the matter further. Tichborn feels that Rosco (a member of
"4 ~ the opposition) Sx probably has more influence on Castro than Rosco realizes

yf “and that this possibility would be worth looking into.

aA AY d. Edward R.Murrow: he produced a-TV program on Castro and Tichbora feels
ot that he might have established a rapport with Castro during this period. .

4. One of the contacts Tichborn made in Cube (the Director of Tourism) asked
him if he knew of anyone who would be interested in coming to Cuba on an all-dxpenses-
paid visit in order to write articles (or other similar propaganda) on present day
Cuba. Tichborn mentioned Clete Roberts, a popular radio and TV commentator in ios
Angeles as a possible candidate. (Tichborn also discussed this matter with Horace
W. Davis.) Tichborn will mention this possibility to Roberts upon hia return to
Californic. :

5. While in Cuba, Tichborn accidently met a young lady who later revealed to
him that she war "an agent for the ZState Dapartrent". He felt that this was a
security gatter and that it should ba brought to our attenticn for that purpose.
WB ote aid not recognize the name; it 13 being further checked cut with WH
Division, The incident and the details will be rade the subject of a separate
memorandum for CI Staff.

6. On the adntnistrative side, 4 Tichherr will forward by raf) his
\ "financial accounting, one copy to the cover company and the other to Henry
_W. Darkin(P). The cover letter which was provided him thy the event that
he cane to the attention of the Cyban authcrities was returned to us and is
now in his fila. (There was no necessity for its use.) Tichborn inquired as to
the possibility of receiving reimbursement for medical exponses which will _
undoubtedly be incurred upon his return to California due to a possible hernia
which developed in New York on hfs.return trip en route to Washington. This is ~
“being checked out by this office. Tichborn departed fgr, Los Angeles (having -been
‘ taken to Freindship International Airport by “enryil—Serkin) at about 1800 .
hours on 1 February 1960.

4. The ex-wife of Valentin HAHM, whose full name {ie rot known to the
writer, and the two HAHN sons, are currently being sponsored for resettle-
mont by the Agency in the United States, where all three are scheduled to
receive their U.S, citgenship under CLA sponsorship.

5. With reference to the ‘Tomorrow is/Too Late” Club, HAHN stated
that a number of CIA Staff Employees of the (Tokyo Station} frequent or have
frequented this establishment and have dated the Japanese huatesses employed

EVES 7

there. Date of HAHN's introduction to the Club and to Noriko MATSUZAKAYA
by George PARIS aka George PERIS was ectimated by fr. Sayle to have been
somewhere between 1954 and 1957. With regard to Valentin HAHN's own
inclinations toward sharing his knowledge of romance with others, Mr. Sayle
advised that Security “ffice had established that while employed as a contract
agent of the [Tokyo Station] HAHN had pimped for CIA Staff personnel in Tokyo.
1373 ©

6, As attachment herewith, the writer appends additional background
data on the professional intelligence activities and contacts of Valentin HAHN
and family as noted during the oral briefing oy Sayle.

7. Om basie of the above, it can be safely assumed that the George
PARIS known to HAHN ts identical with George PERISTERGPOULOS aka
George PERIS, weil-known Tokyo businessman and Honorary Deputy Consal
of the Royal Greek Consulate in Yokohama, Japan, as reported in SCTGKY-63
and SCTOKY-64. It is noteworthy that PERIS’ contacts throughout his career.
commencing ¥ “tn ms original reported employment in Tientsin, China, through
bie activities and contacts in Shanghai, Caina, and later in Tokyo, not exciud-
‘ing his marriage to Aurelia CZZRWINSKA, have been exclusively with
individuals of Russian or Eastern Zuropean background, many of them of
Ruselan Jewish background, who are eitber highly suspect or have been iden-
tiffed as long-time agents of Soviet Intelligence. PERIS’ reported route of
arrival in Tokyo via Harbin, Tientsin and Shanghai, as well as his employ-
ment by Sondovich Brothsrs and.contacts with individuals who tie in with th -
Boris SOLOMONIK complex and Borsol Fur Trading Corporation, smacke
very strongly of the old Cominterr Apparat of the 20's and 30's. Also it
parallets ihe travel patterns of a number of individuals involved in the SOBLE
saee, principally the SCBLES themselves who were exfiitrated irom the
Soviet Union via Toxyo, Japan, to the U.S.A. and who, most notably of all,
also were under cover of operating a Bristie Business as is Sondovics Brothers,

8. According to earlier reporting in the ZRGRACE investigation,

_ George PERIS is alleged to have been a contact of William Hamilton MARTIN

in Tokyo, and to have offered MARTIN some type of jod or business partner-
ship deal in connection with the rug business.

9. Mr. Carrico informally indicated that he personally suspects that
MARTIN'‘s Introductisn to the fine art of masochistic torture by an unideoti-
fied Japanese fomaie, as reported by Mro. Ardelie GASDA to FAI agents,
may have been effected at or through his patronage of the ‘Tomorrow is Too
Late” Club to which he may well have been taken or introduced by bis friend
PERIS, Thies possibility, however, is subject to farts investigation.

: 2 .
10. As initial fotlow-up to[SCTOKY}-63 and[SCTOKY}e4, outgoing cable
of 7 Sept. 60 requesting further check-out of the Club, etc. was prepared.

dibaci

Page 4:
14-00000

A second cable to be sent by Privacy Lank to Seoul, Korea, has also been
érafted, and requests check of PERIS' arrival, activities and contacts,
departure from Korea subsequent to 28 January 1960, This cable has been
presented separately for your approval and may likely be sudject to revision,
wierefore no copy is attached. It ie further suggested that Cifice of Security
be authorized to pass to NSA Security Officiale working on this case the
information on PERIS relayed in above [SC KYkables, such information to
be properly sterilized of course, and that NSA in turn be requested to check
and obtain from U.S. Navy Personnel Records ful copies in duplicate of the
orginal reports on the specific duty stations or assignments, including dates
of service at each, to which MARTIN and MITCHELL were cetailied, also
detailed leave recorde, travel records, and other pertinent background data
contained in such files, to cover the entire period of their respective service
with the U.S. Navy. It is also suggested that NSA officials be requested to
obtain similar detailed original reports in duplicate from the Denartment of.
ahs Army te eves cue porsoa Of MAK SIN's Civilian employment in Japan,
with speciat emphasis on any reports of MARTIN's extra-curricular activities,
contacts, club memberships, identified personal contacts with persons sot
employed in his own office, leave travel, etc., which may be reflected in
official records. One copy of all such reports are requested for thie Agency,
to permit further checking of known or newly identified contacts he may have
had in Japan.

5. Sore of the more significant hi, hlirhts of the conv-rsaticns hich -
tock place betwen AYAUNG=1 and the undersiyned prior to his weetings with the
W/T operator (Francisco) and Jitezeral are noted herewith:

a. Security: Castro wg tuken stringent acti n in tirhtening up
his internal security a, ainst counterer:voluticnary forces inside
Cuba. The raiitia arr being usec to search heus-s for concesled
weapons (usually by a hlock system), and anyone failing to produce
proper identification ic removed for questicning by the NiER.
Hence, ANAUNC-1 ani his organizati.. are largely ccnfining their
aCtivities to the daylizht hours from C700 to 2000 haurs. He
considers night operaticns - particularly cn the st:ects of Ravana -
as highly dangerous inasmuch as the Di: (security orrans) are -
ecnstantly on the alert to stop individuals cn the street to check
their identification dccuments.

bs Documentati:n of Avents in Cuba: AYAUNG-1 surgested using an
identiricati-n card issued by the Havana University for their

students. He had a sarple copy in his ;ossession, which he cleins- O

was readily accepted by Castro security, forces as being valid.

Sirdlarly, 3 driver's license procerly authenicated along with a —
health certiricate were considorec to ba gocd Ycover® docurents —_
for a,ents cperating in the Havana area. A sup; sly of blank identi-

agents whe can be passed off es students at the Ravana University.
(He sugested preparing cae for tis w/T o;erator (Francisco).

©. Operaticnal Expenditures: CQue:ied on this aspect, *SCNG-1 stated
his organizati n-»culd need a minimum of 50 to 60,N0 pesos a
month to cover their overall operaticnal expenses. These funds are
being used for safehouse raintenance, travel expenses, purchase of
vehicles and gascline, ailoraticn of funds to vericus sub- :
divisions of the AMYUM organizaticn located in varicus provinces of
Cuba, and purchase of food and support of various arents whose
families may be in dire need of food and medical surrlies.

da. w/t O,erators: To date, both AvPANICs14 and AYCIEX~2) have net
mot the requirements for effective coraunica! ion with us on AYYUF ©

operat.cns. However, AFAUNG-1 feels that AYPANICw2% has not been
compromised or turned by the DIDx and once he rets over his nervous
state, it is possible he can stil] be used, Similariy, although -
AYGLEN-1 ds considered to ba a co d W/T cjerator, AYXNGs) fecls
: his usefulnoss to hie has been considerably nejatet by the nature
: of his assignment at the Naval bese end his recent restrictions
, to this base by orders of the Castro regire. In stort, AYRUNG-L
feels com-unicaticn is the weakest link in his currest epera’
and that direct com-unicati:ns with the Embsazsy is growing ine!
eroasingly hazardous, due to the fact that Embassy rerscnnel cre
under close survedllance by the Castre cecurity forces. For this
reason he feels that Francisco wil) fill a sericus wid in this
respect, once he is infiltrated into the AMYUK orgarasation in

Cuba.

e. Support for other anti-Castro gro: ps in Cuba: AYSTMe2 stated that
all materiel suport srculd bo funneled directly te his organiza.

i his view this would sorve as a ccntrol factor in-unifying the over.
1 all effort of the varicus spiinter ,roups seeking svct suppcrt in -
i Cuba and ould also entsnce the pfestice of the MRE ss the spesr
: head for the FRINTS,. He then went on to acd that he was fully —
: aware of our efforts to supsort other groups in Cuba, which he ©
: aosumed ve were operating wath on @ unilateral basis. (i.e, he
1 sited Nino Diag in Oriente). AMWNCG~l felt this wis a serious —
! mistake, as this unilateral suport would affect the leadership and
directicn now being provided by the MAR Shroughout Cub. . The,
undersigned told AvalXG-) that he arpreed on the desirability of
H &@ cocrdinate d effort on the part of all counter-revolut: onary
groups seeking to overthrow Castro using the FRENTE as the rally. - :
ing center. However, tie question of sup-ort deing:étee ted -
through one channel namely: his organization in Cué, was neither
feasible nor practical. The feet that Castro had tightened up
security throughout the varicus previnces of Cuba, 2 make it
difficult or possible for the AMYUM greup te ship ares and other
equipsent from Havana te the eastern ost provinces (t.e., Las

H Villas, Casaguay of Oriente) without jeopardizing both shiprents

! and person el. Hence, the need for unilateral action on our

! part to sup.ay those fighting groups in these provinces. This
explanaticn appeared te satisfy AYEUNG-1, however he still insisted
that his organizatt n should at least be appraised of any rateriel

support provided other groups in Cuba. He was sesured that wa
would take Lis request under consideraticn.

f. abRLDP¥-11 AYKUNG.1 feels that nc useful purzose would be served
in sending his a:stciaty to join forces with him in Havana. He
feels that ArBIDDY-1 should continue te represent the AYYUM
facticn in the FAD and when the counter-r: volutivr-ry forces are
fully prepared to everthrow the Castro reg-re, aPf2INTY-1 will be
brought into the Pinar del Rio to direct the AYYUY forces in this

province.

g@- BKanclo Ray: AbalNG-1 considers RAY as a hipnly dan-erous individual
because of his great ambiticn to play a prerinent role in any
subsoquent Cuban gov: rnsent following the overthrow of the Castro
regine. In his opinion, RAY poses a soricus threat to VAHCNA*s
leadership and the FRD inside Cuba. Ho is attempting to draw .
various dissident groups to hie banners 2nd appeurs to have support -"--
from the riddle class represented by business intercats, politiciats,
and the professicnal class. Should iY te persuaded to join
forces wath the FKD, AXUNG-1 thinks he wi:l cortirnue to operate
on & unilateral basis while geeking to supercede the FRD with ©
his om crganizaticn in Cuba. .

h. Tony Varona_and the FRD: Although AFRUNG-1 reccgnizes the neod
to support the FRD as a political front for rallying counter-
revolutionary grou,s against the Castro regive, he n netheless
feels that the FHENIE and Tony ViKCNA hove lost eensiderable face
dn Cuba by inaction and political maneuv~ rings He further pointed
out that he 4a avare that thousands of dollars rad been poured into
the FRraTz, but dissident groups in Cuba hve s<en no evidence of
any of this money to sup ort their efforts to cverthrow Castro. —
Hence, ccnfidence in the F!D is at a relatively low ebb amcny the
people in Cuba and a new shot in the arm in the form of materiel
and financial support is needed to restora this confidences- Ace
conding to “FiUNG-1 vhie eup. ort must be forti.coming soon because
such peo;le as Manolo RaY ere taidng the initistive and will socn
contrcl the entirc counter-revolut onary movement in Cuba,

On Sunday, October 28, I met twice with Manolo RAY of the Mcyiaiento ¥ =

siwein = list of Usbans, either inside or outside the island, who could be
availaile, in case of an emergency, to help in eatting up sexe kind of
provisional government; and (3) to have his general views on the poseibility.
of an inaurreetionary ‘movement.

Since I had arranged to return to Washington on the same day, I did
net give Ray muck vias to do a thorough jot. However, he was able to
furnish me with a list of names, covering pointe (1) and (2). He proateed
to provide me with suditional irformatien after checking with some of his
arsociate@ in Kew York ard Miami. Eis thoughts on the possibility of an
insurrectionary movement 2411 be the subject of a separate nenorandun.

MEMORANDUM FOR :; Ghief, Special Affairs Staff
ATTENTION 3: Mr, A, Rodriquez

SUBJECT 3 Radio Switch Equipment for Demolition
Firing Purposes

° 1, After our conversation on ‘his subject on 30 December,
the question was discussed with Mr. fay Alpern,) TSD/AOB, and
us (Lee Poole, )TSD/QRF, The following information i¢ forwarded
for your consideration as a result of our discussions,

7

°
sn Be Mr.(atpeen) Audio Operations Branchy-recommends two
companies.as sources of cquipmient of thie nature, These companies
have experience, under classified contracts with TSD, in producing
reliable equipment for special purposes of this sort. They also,
of course turn out commercial equipment of good quality for normal
communications needs, These companies are:

29,0
a. (Motorola, Chicago, Illinois >
bi Kel, Cambridge, Maseachusetta ) 29,08

The TSD VHF radio switth edalpardnt for demolition needs was
developed for us by/Mctorola. 'Kell-Com! }ransistoriszed sets have
been produced to mest the special needs (rét for demolition purposes)

: of other SAS projects,

3. In the opinion of both persons conaulted, the expenses noted
in our first discussion should have produced a reasonable amount of
workable equipment if the source was both capable and reliable, s
JSD recommends the use of frequencies in the VHF /WHF spectrum for
equipment of this sort and crystal tuning control for reasons of reliabikty,

selectivity and rejection of spurious signals.

. 4. Inexpensive equipment of Japanese or American manufacture
in the citizen’ band frequency ranges for toys, radio contro! devices,

RETURN TO CLA

; ‘Background Use Only

‘ip

Bo Not Reproducs Page Two

short range communications, etc., is available from many
manufacturers, Our Quick Reaction Facility can produce a

emall number of radio switches based on these deviczs witha
considerably lester degree of security from false signal triggering
with a lead time of 6 to 8 weeka, Simple mechanical protection
against accidental triggering can be gained by inclusion of counting
switches, for example, which require a preset number of firing
impulses intentionally transmitted to produce the final closure of

a relay and firing of a charge.

5. Reliability of operation in terms of response toa
transmitted signal of a given power is quite difficult to predict when
conditions of antenna length, orientation and exposure cannot be
foreseen, Location of the receiver.in a target building will also have
a strong bearing on 'range' from the transmitter, Building construction,
intervening obstacles and interference from other nearby radio fre~
quency sources will affect performance of the set.

6 you wish to discuss the pro*'ems in greater depth,

we recommend a conference with audio ‘echniciane or engineernr,

It may serve to clarify the appropriate haracteristice which special or m
modified commercial equipment shoule possess to megt the needs of your
operation. Prtblems of camouflaging the explosive or incendiary materul
to serve operational requirements would be minor compared to the
necessary consideration of effects on the receiver switch concealed
within which could have important effects on performance. :

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with AMBANG-1

1, I met with AMBANG-1 on 27 July 1963 in Miami,
The following is a resume of the business transacted at that

meeting.

a. Request for High Explosives

AMBANG-] stated that in view of my outline

of strategic targets inside Cuba during our last meeting which

took place in Washington on 2) June 1963, he had decided to

attempt a sabotage operat on against the Havana power plant.

He informed me that he has a man employed in the power plant

in Havana who is capable of launching this operation, In this
connection AMBANG-} asked if we could make available twenty
pounds of high explosives as well as six to eight thermite grenades.
AMBANG-1 asked if it were poscible to have the twenty pounda
broken into smaller lots. In our further discussion of this subject,
it became apparent that A-1 would be willing to receive the materiel
either in San Juan or inside Cuba, but that he definitely. preferred
the latter if this were possible, Like in mést other instances during
our conversation, 1 advised AMBANG-] that I would need to discuss
this matter with my superiors but that I could tentatively assure.
him of our ability and willingness to furnish the high explosives in .
San Juan and possibly inside Cuba. At this point I asked AMBANG-1
‘if he could foresee the need for matericl of this type inside Cuba.

T told him that I asked this question because if his group were
prepared now or in the Rear future for meaningful sabotage action
inside Cuba it was conceivable that we could begin the caching of
needed materiel inside Cuba. AMBANG-1 assured me that they

whe

Pyne eet

pan +

1 SRI Rta INE LE PES te Rabe cow APNE

were in a position to sabotage the electrical plant in Havana. (1
did not ask, neither did he specify which plant.) He did not promise
immediate action, adding that he wanted to assure himseli of the
details of the planned operation and the safety-odds of the man
involved, A-] then indicated that he would certainly be in a”
position to accomplish this mission and others in the future and
would be most grateful for any materiel we could put in place.

I left the matter with him with the understanding that if it were
possible we would proceed with caching the high explosives in
the general area of Havana, He assured me of their capability
to service and retrieve the cache,

b. Request for Contact in Guantanamo

AMBANG-] asked me if it would be possible for ug
to arrange some means for Rogelio Cisneros to visit Guatanamo
and talk to his brother who is an employee of the Naval Base and
another agent of theirs likewise employed there. The reason A-1
gave for the request was that they wished to inform Ramon Cisneros
Diaz of the JURE plans to begin the implementation of their plan
of resistance and overthrow of the Castro Regime. I advised A-1
that whereas J would look into this matter as I could tentatively
tell him that the chances of accomplishing this were remote,

ce. AMBANG-) Political Plans

AMBANG-1] informed me that he was planning at
this time to be in New York on or about 10 August and that following
this trip he intended to go to Santo Domingo and Caracas. In Santo
Domingo he hoped to set up a small base for operations such as a
small house on a farm near the shore which could be used for boat
travel to Cuba. Once he had made such arrangements he intended
to talk to President Juan Bosch telling him of the plan and asking
his acquiescence if not support. AMBANG-1 intends to tell Bosch
that he will not embarrass him and will go about his business in a
secure and professional manner adding that if he should embarrass
Bosch, the latter could disclaim him and ‘A-! would desist from :
any further activity there. . . ‘ \

So far as AMBANG-]'s trip to Caracas is concerned, that
will be principally devoted to orienting the JURE representation

teed


Page 3:
14-0000

t

et eraecine

in that city. In addition, AMBANG-1 will attempt to see and talk
to Venezuelan Government officials including President Betancourt.

Some time after this trip AMBANG-1 intends to visit
Central America principally Costa Rica and if he can procure a
visa, Mexico. The purpose of all his travel is the raising of funds,
the general tightening of his organization and discussions neccessary
to coordinate their efforts.

da. Isolation of Cuba.

AMBANG-1 made it exceedingly clear that the
lifeline to his assets inside Cuba had been severely restricted
when PAA flights were suspended, Nothing could suit AMBANG-1
more than to have these flights resumed. AMBANG-1's obviously
great interest in the resumption of these flights was the most eloquent
statement yet of his belief.that he has a network, or that he can
revive a network within Cuba. At least at this stage of JURE
operations, AMBANG-1 does not appear to consider the infiltration
of manpower as necessary,

AMBANG-1 stated that the use of flights from Spain and
Mexico to Cuba was difficult and costly whereas the Miami-Havana
run had been most useful in maintaining contact within Cuba. It |
was AMBANG-I's opinion that the resumption of PAA flights would
be an operational boom to JURE and that whereas he could see
Castro making some. political capital out of the flights, he believed
that some appropriate statement such as "there is no political
significance but only'a humanitarian and compassionate reason for
the reestablishment of this link, " would be sufficient to negate any

political advantage by Castro.

e. AMBANG-1 Phasing Out of his Employment

AMBANG-1 gave me to believe that he is closing shop
and giving up his position with the Corporacion de Renovacion Urbana:
y Viviendas where he is employed as an engineer in charge. of building
pre-cast concrete houses. AMBANG-! stated that during the past
week Governor Munoz Marin gave final authority for.the erection
of a plant to produce these houses in Puerto Rica. AMBANG-]) is

ead

oe


Page 4:
14-0000

~4-

torn with the thought of leaving this project which he believes
will be most successful, and which would assure his livelihood,
but he knows that he must devote himself to the fight against
Castro, It ie obvious to me that AMBANG-1 will within the next
two months phase out of this employment to devote full time to
the liberation of Cuba,

{£ A JURE Radio Link

AMBANG-1 asked me if ] would be able to assist
him in the establishment of a San Juan-Caracas-Miami radio link.
He explained that the JURE has spent a great deal of money on
telephonic communications between these points and were most
anxious to set up a means of radio communication in order to
economize, J guess that AMBANG-1 could tell from my reaction
that I was not too sympathetic to his request for he withdrew it
almost as soon as he had made it. He went on to say that this
was a problem which they could overcome and I presume that he
will seek to establish such radio communications without our

assistance,

g. Aerial Maps of Cuba

AMBANG-] informed me that the JURE membership
had brought out of Cuba an entire series of maps showing key roads,
bridges, industrial plants, et al, which they had copied by the Aero
Service Corporation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, AMBANG-1
stated that they had received most of these photos from the Aero
Service Corporation but that the 101 were still missing. He gave
me the numbers of those missing and asked if we could procure them,
Ihave since informed AMBANG-1 that it would perhaps be best it
he could, or his organization, do this instead but that we would
pay the travel of one of his men, should this prove necessary.-
Attached, hereto, is a copy of the missing photos in question.

h, JURE Organization and Strength

AMBANG-1 igformed me that the membership of the
JURE in San Juan was now at about 500 members and‘that each
of these individuals makes a weekly contributionto the organization,

y


Page 5:
14-0000

“Ty

-S-

In addition there are large JURE organizations in Caracas, Venezucla
and Dallas, Texas. There are according to AMBANG-! a total

of thirty delegations in Latin America, the U.S, A. and Europe,

He cited ae an example the delegation in San Francisco which had
recently purchased a typewriter through the collection of green
etamps. He added that Rogelio Cisneros had travelled to San
Francisco some time ago to communicate with that group and to
tighten its organizational activities,

i. AMBANG-1 Asks About ARTIME and the Activities |
in Central America

AMBANG-! raised the question of Manuel ARTIME's
activities in Central America and particularly in Nicaragua. He
stated that any association with Somoza would not help in creating
the mistique and political coloration necessary to inspire revolution
and resistance from the non-Communists clements in Cuba. Whereas,
J had expected AMBANG-! to go into a long harangue as to the
positive damage that ARTIME's actions with Somoza could cause,
he left the matter at about this point, I agreed that the Somozas did not
have a Jiberal political reputation throughout Latin America, but
added that whatever Cubans ca: ld do from that or any vantage point
against Communism in Cuba would in my estimation be helpful, --
while Iam sure AMBANG-1! did not agree with me, he did not say
60, In respect to ARTIME and Miro Cardona, whose name entered
into the conversation Jater, AMBANG-1 took a fairly objective view.
He stated that Miro had arrived in San Juan and that he wished him
the best aa he figured he had suffered enough. Insofar as ARTIME
was concerned I gathered that AMBANG-1 might fee) that the associ-

. ation with Somoza would not do ARTIME any good in a post-Castro

Cuba, As AMBANG-I! is convinced that a government after Castro
must be of a progressive liberal stripe, ARTIME was not doing
himself any good by identifying himself with the Sommozas,

j. A List of Cuban Diplomats

As AMBANG-] had asked for a list of Cuban Diplo-
mats abroad while wewere in Paris, I advised him that euch a list
had been prepared and we would make it available to him, In this
connection he asked if we could include the addresses of each of the
Cuban installations. Speaking of diplomats, AM BANG-] wanted to

-~6.-

know if Ambassador Gustavo Arcos had returned from Prague.

1 informed him that I did not know. AMBANG-1 was most interested
to learn that Franqui's' wife and children had actually come out of
Cuba, and indicated that he would intensify his efforts to maintain
contact with Cuban Diplomat Cabrera Infante in Bruseels as a
means toward the eventual recruitment of Franqul.

kK AMBANG-1 Relation with Jorge Volsky

In conjunction with questions regarding propaganda
sent to Cuba, and the JURE's genera! plans in this field, I asked
A-! about his relation with Jorge Volsky. A-1 stated that he con-
sidered Volaky to be an extremely. able, serious newspaperman.
He added that whereas he saw Volsky frequently on hia trips to
Miami, the latter did not work for him. A-1 stated that Volsky's
work was a full-time job which left him little time to do anything

else.

A-] stated that JURE propaganda was produced by a twelve -
man board.

A-1 added that the JURE expected to shortly introduce a
statement on its position into Cuba,

1, AMBANG-I Asks about Two Man Underwater Craft

A-l asked if 1] knew anything about a two man type
craft which travels through the water. I presume A-] was talking
about the "sea-sled."' I advised him that I know little about thia
type craft, but in my opinion ite usefulness for the type activity
he had in mind was limited. AMBANG-1 would use this craft for
the final phase of an infiltration effort. A-1 stated that this craft
was being used at the hotel beaches in San Juan as a type of sporting
activity. I will advise him that he could pursue this matter himeclf
ae all knowledge on this subject is publicly available. Ds

was given some eighty pills with which he will be able to make
the "ink" used in this system of S/W. A-l was pleased with the
Systers, elyeciaily ate esmpiicity, He wih use tne syste to

communicate with his chief delegate in Paris and undoubtedly
other persons in Cuba as well as in the other JURE delegations. —

a, AMBANG-Lis Writing an Articie for Cuadernos

At the request of German Arcienegas, the famed
Colombian intellectual, A-1] is preparing an article which is to be
published in Cuadernos, The article will dea! with the problems
facing Latin America and how they can be resolved. A-] will be in
select company as Arcienegas has asked a number of prominent

Latin American intellectuals for their views.

°. Communication Between AMBANG-1 and Case

Officer

AMBANG-] gave me the following addreszes at which
he can be reached:

Urbana y Viviendas

_ PARADA 31
Ponce de Leon,

Hato Rey :
' Puerto Rico Telephone No. 723-1671

(NOTE: This is not- AMBANG's office or home, but-that of a
friend who is always able to reach A-]. )

Also; —

Mr. Jaime Mitrani
1260 W. 61 Place
Hialeah, Florida

AMBANG-! was given the following means of
contacting me: °

Mr. Alfred Fernandez
P.O. Box 1104, Main Post Office
Washington, D. C. Telephone No, 737-8294

AMBANG-! will use the name "Tony" as a signature in mail
to me, _..



Page 8:
14-00000

2. General Observations
I beleive AMBANG-1 is planning to return to ‘Cuba.

He indicated that he would give the matter serious thought to
even go in, ‘disguised, as a legal traveller if that road were
generally open, i.e., if rather large numbers of travellers were
going in via PAA flights. This line seemed a bit out of character
for A-], for it seems unrealistic and somewhat remindful of Macaulay's
references to the state of mind that exilea develop, I also detected
what we consider to be a somewhat unrealistic appraisal of the Cuban
Situation in A-1's estimate that Castro has coneidcrably less than
40% of the Cuban people with him. A-1 may be losing more than a
little touch with Cuban reality.

A-1 remains convinced that he is on the right track in
working for the eventual overthrow of Castro, He is convinced,
however, that two to three years is all the time left for actually
destroying the Castro regime, belicving that there will be a favorable
turn in the Cuban economic situation by late 1965. A-l is likewise
convinced that Castro cannot add to the improvement of Cuba, to
the contrary that so long as the principal decisions are made by
Castro, the general trend will be confusion arising from a failure
to concentrate on specific problems until they are corrected.

AMBANG-1 is likewise convinced that the JURE is building
a political group and general outlook which will have an impact on
Cuba for many years to come. He is especially concerned with the
-need to carefully consider cach position of his grow in order to
create the lasting impression that JURE knows where it is going
and that its leadership is composed of men who know how to "run"
a@ country without the false starts, confusion and chaos identified

with the Castro regime.

AMBANG-] is likewise greatly concerned with the necessity
of not creating an impression inside Cuba that the JURE will return
to mete out "Justice." It is essential, A-l states, to convince the
general populace that the overthrow of Castro will not result ina
bloodbath, rather.that the sole aim is to eave the revolution that -
has been betrayed. He is anxious that the people inside Cuba see


Page 9:
14-0000

the JURE as a responsible, intelligent and dispassionate group
which is capable of bringing to Cuba all that the revolution promised.

the identity and addrese of the trainee. Training included the
clandestine operaticn of a RS-1, the use of s3ifnal plans, the use
of pads in coding and decoding, and personal security. Training

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Possible DRE Animus Towards President Kennedy

1, This memorandum makes record of a recollection
which has been brought to mind in recent weeks since my return
from Yugoslavia in late November 1966.

2. In Spring 1961, upon returning from Berlin I was
assigned to JMWAVE. One of the cases on which I worked from
then until shortly before my reassignment to Headquarters in
late summer 1963 concerned funding of overseas elements of
the DRE (Student Revolutionary Directorate) which had its main
office in Miami (the case officer for this group during this
period was Mr. Ross CROZIER, since resigned).

3. Ibelieve that it is this group, the DRE, which has been
referred to in investigations into the President's assassination .
as the Cuban Student Directorate, whose New Orleans represen-
tative is said to have had contacts with OSWALD,

4. Thave assumed that, since the time I was transferred
from Miami and scheduled for my next assignment as feos, at
{0 [Zagreb,} officers better and more recently informed than myself
ave probably éxamined in detail all aspects of the DRE involve-
ment with OSWALD, in order to rule out any slight possibility
that compromise of the CIA sponsorship of this organization
might in any way embarrass the Agency. Recent news reports of
investigations centering in New Orleans on the assassination have
once again brought to mind the concern I felt in November 1963,
by which time, however, I was far removed from current knowledge

of the operation.



Page 2:
14-00000

ek we

°

5. Ido retain a distinct recollection that the DRE leader-
ship, specifically Luis FERNANDEZ Rocha, whom I met several
times, did hold sentiments of chagrin and embitterment that
President Kennedy had not more forcefully pursued a "liberation"
of Cuba. Whether or not this animus, which could be discerned
as occasional signs of anger or of contempt or of discouragement,
might have been translated into a wish for revenge, may be better
known to other officers who dealt with this group after the summer

*. of 1963,

MEMORANDUM TO: WH/C/OPS

SUBJECT =; Call. from Mr. Dick Philips (State)
: Regarding the Arrest of AMLEQ=3

._, ls Mr. Dick Philips said that he received a call from
Mitchell L. WER-BELL about the arrest of AMLEO-3, The
following information is contained in CIA files regarding
Mr. WER-BELL:

"Subject was born March 1918, in Philadelphia,
Ee served in the OSS during World War II and later opened
4 public relations and advertising firm in Atlsnta. During
the past three years he has entered various import/export
ventures in.Latin America and Florida, He was in the
Dominican Republic during the past summer, He is well-known ‘
to thls Agency and is categorized as unscrupulous and a .
Promoter with grandiose schemes. Although he has offered
to work for us, he has never been used. He Claims close
friendship with many Latin American political and military
figures."

2, The three Cubans that WER-BELL reported arrested
are Jose Ricardo RABEL Nunez (AMLEO-3), Gilberto Fondora
and Miguel Ramos. These men were crew members of the JURE
mother vessel VENUS, From JMWAVE reports it appears that
AMLEO-3 was attempting to exfiltrate his family, using the
VENUS, when he was caught by Cuban security forces on

3 September 1965.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with AMBUNNY-1 (291-775391) and
AMWHIP-1 (201-267966)

DATE: 25 May 1965, 1900-2039 hours
PLACE: Office of AMWHIP=1, 31 W. 47th St., New York, ‘N.Y.
i

PRESENT: AMBUNNY-1, AMWHIP-1, and DAMICONE using alias of
Al MARIN .

'
| 1. I had introduced AMPUNNY-1 and AMWHIP-1 to each other '
24 May but the office was crowded, so there was very little :
| Opportunity to discuss operational matters. We met again
i on the above date, after business hours, and we were able
| to meet in private. Although AMWHIP told me that he was
Hl delighted with AMBUNNY-1 herself, as he said the ‘Cubans
| like that kind of girl -~ not too fancy", he thought that
‘= her background ~— particularly her previously working for the
| 9 (u.s. Ambassador in Bolivia.)would aake the operation very
: | risky. He said that itfit were discovered that ANPUNNY-~1l was
i a penctration of the NAFU~19 office (by the Cubars} his
connection with ODYOKE would the e revealed, with the result
that all bis “connections” withQNSNAFU-19, and “Habana” would
be lost. AMWHIP-1 opined that he thought 1t likely that ‘the
| Cubans would check ber out in livia) ;
!
|
i
’

2. AMWHIP suggested the? ssibllity of using a cutout
to introduce AMBUNNY-1l to the (UNBNAFU-19 iostallation. He
said he would explain in detail at a later time, what he
meant, obviously not wanting to reveal any more than necessary

to AMBUKNY-1.

3. Also, AMWHIP~2 stated that he was unable to travel
to Paris before midwJune, as he nad sowe relatives coming
to visit him from Italy. After checking with DI UBALDO,

I subsequently informed AMWHIP-1 and AMBUNNY-1 that the
(5-4 (aris operation was off. Both expressed relief. I told
AMDUNNY-1 that she could most likely still be utilized in
\2-2 (RabaQ, and that we would discuss the possibilities ata -
ater date.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Contact Report, Meeting with AMWHIP-1

SUBJECT:

DATE 21 May 1965, 1300-1430 hours
PLACE :_ National Airport

PRESENT Subject and DiUbaldo as Breitheim

1, On 20 May I phoned Subject and requested that he travel to
Washington to discuss the background of his discussions with
QUNSNAFU-19 from which stemmed the suggestion that A-1 supply a
French- English-Spanish speaking secretary to(19's mission in
Paris, The meeting was quit short fur as it turned out, the hoet
discussion between Subject andQ19 on the topic of secretaries, fad’
taken place in March 1965, aad had been little more than a casual
sort of thing devoid of any specifics whatever and, in particular,
devoid of any commitment by cither party to proffer or to accept a
profferred body. Nevertheless, Subject felt quite certain that slots
would still be open {RU319's mission and that a recommendation from
him would suffice to effect favorable action by G19,

2

2. I sketched AMBUNNY's qualifications stressing the fact that
she had gone to school in the U,S,, had worked here, and had done
a hitch as a social secretary for the(American Ambassador in La Paz. 0
Subject drew the obvious conclusions that it might be difficult to
dummy up AMBUNNY's labenslauf adequately to prevent her from
being “discovered" by the Cubans. At any rate, since she was our

only candidate, Subject agreed to meet with her in New York so that
together they could thresh out the pragmatics of the problem.
meeting was set for 22 May.

punt
: . -2-

: 3. For the record, I should like to note that in the two anda
half years since I had last seen. Subject he had aged over 15 years.
When I last saw him he was a round-faced, dark-haired, boyish person
and has now been transformed into a very grey, very puffy, 50 year old
man though I understand his chronological age is something short of 40.
These observations ‘kx nothing to do with anything except they might
indicate that Subject is living under a great Strain, I derived the
impression, which coincides with that I obtained the first time I met
with Subject, that he is constitutionally oblique in his approach to
matters. He is a very difficult person to corner. Iam firmly
convinced that to date in this operation, if it may be called that, we have

"never come close to placing Subject in the corner and that it is high time
we do so, Ido not imply that he is a man of ill will, rather that
instinctively he is a man who slides off problems until such time as he
feels he has sufficient evidence or is in the right posture to solve them.
I should think it would be our task to exploit these natural capacities
while at the same time attempting to assure that Subjectty not sliding
away from us,

A fairly reliable source, in a report dated 17 July. 1962, |~

Seccion Preparacion y Organizacion Combativa (Section for |
the Preparation and Organization of Warfare - SPOC), the

September 1963 that Major Jose Ramon FERNANDEZ Alvarez, Chief 7
of Training, General Staff of the Cuban Rebel Aray, is anti-
Communist and a military type in the strictest sense of the
word. He sticks to his military duties acd scrupuloesly
avoids politics; he keeps himself completely isolated from
all political elements. He ig proud of his present status
and thankful to CASTRO for it; for fear of losing it he
appears uhwilling to undertake any kind of activity against
-the CASTRO regime. CASTRO is undoubtedly knowledgeable of
PERNANDEZ’ attitude and has sufficient confidence in him to.
retain him in his present position. CASTRO also is aware
that he has few officers with the military discippine, --
know-how, and experience possessed by FERNANDEZ.

Service - SSR). This document was signed by Fernando FUENTE Coba,
Chief of the Confidential Section of the General Command of the

National Revolutionary Police.

In’a report dated 19 May 1962, an untested source, who was a guide
and interpreter for the ICAP, a Cuban government agency which

1, Although source saw Julian NOVAS Fernandez at the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico City in March 1964, the records of this

The following traces by this Agency is the basis for
this conclusion.

2. An (official Jamatcai-soared in -d report dated 24 March 1964,
stat®éd that Julian NOVAS Férnandez arrived in Kingston,
Jamaica, on 18 Warch 1964, to take up his duties at the

his wife did not accompany him and source speculated that her
arrival may be delayed in view of NOVAS‘ present inclination for

feminine diversion.

In a report dated March 1964, this same source said that

Julian NOVAS Fernandez, the Cuban Commercial Attache at the

Cuban Consulate in Kingston, Jamaica, was born on 2 September 1938,
in Habana, Cuba. He carried diplomatic passport D/64/90 which

waS issued in Habana on 20 February 1964.- His home address was
given as Carman No. 18, Vibora. He arrived in Kingston from
Mexico on 18 March 1964, on Mexicana Flight Number 305.

This same source, “in a report dated 28 April 1964, stated that
..the wife of Julian:NOVAS Fernandez, the recently arrived Cuban
Commercial Attache, arrived in Kingston on 22° April 1964,

via Mexico. Her name is Amarilis Marta VALDES Hijuelos and
she was born on 19 May 1937, in Jiquani, Oriente, Cuba. VALDES
has been indisposed since her arrival in Kingston; this is
probably due to her advanced pregnancy. Her home address it
Cuba is Avenida 31, Number 3622, Habana. She carried diplomatic

passport D,64,/239, issued in Habana on'9 April 1964.

This same source, in.a report dated 9 May 1964, noted that
the salary and allowances of the new Cuban Commercial Attache,

‘Julian NOVAS Fernandez, suggests that he is the new Cuban

Intelligence Service chief in Jamaica, succeeding Gerardo
SANCHEZ Robert.

to an ineffectual level the tofluence of international
Coemumisma, to encourege desecratic governzent, and te
keep the Mexican government friendly and favcrably in-
elined toward U. 8. policies. Purther guidance is given
in the current CCB Regional Operations Plan for Latin

cperational Emphasis. The Station's prisary emphasis

wiil continue to piaced on clandcatine collection
overations and covert ection operaticns against the

threat presented by Cozemnist Cuba to U, 8, interests in
latin America, coveraze cf Cuban revoluticnary ectivities
in Mexico has been waie a apecific requirement under
Priority A. Fricrity B obfectives and tasxs include
refinenents cf desired efforts and alao pssvids fcr covert

former task for preductica of acticn prturez and their

requirenent; two forner tasks pertaining to the possible
use of fcreign diplomate have been combined; a tasx to

teen added. Two previcus Priority C cbhjectives have been
elininated, aa thore 1s no established Kexican intelli-
gence service, and the Station regularly reports oa

in the possibility of being assigned under unofficial cover to Spain, :
saying that both he and his wife would welcome such an assignment. The
Subject has also said in those conversations that he would not take it
amiss if an opsortunity for reassignment outside of the Central America-
Caribbean area were to become open to him at any time orior to June 1958,

3. In the opinion of the Station, Vaivada has done a very good job.
here, having been confronted with and overcome a number of difficult i

The Station is happy to reccmmend that his request for reassignment be

TO Headquarters Desk

| quRoUGH:  Chiee of Station, Havana, Cuba

1. While at Headquarters in the early part of May 1957, it wae verbally
agreed that I return to Cuba for about one year, security permitting,

2. While ry overational work in Cuba from August 195i until February
1957 was concentrated on commnist targets in the University of Habana, it
should te pointed out that my duties during that period also involved many
contacts with subversive oprositionist elements, ‘hen goverrrental persecution
increased during February 1957, two of my key agents were lost, one of than
by governmental assassination, so that I was obliged to leave Cuba temporarily
perding clarification of tne security factors involved, During my three
months atsence in PEPRIVE the local situation deteriorated; and after ny
return ny position wes less favorable than it had been as a newcomer sime I
had lost assets tut nad retained the cumlative security hazards of three years
of cultivation and reeruitrent efforts. The University was, and still is,
closed. Our comumist penetration efforts are continuously harrassed by
official persecuticn of the target group, | . .

:m 45

begin to study the ocssibilities for reassignment about June 1958, or prior
to that date if necessary. As to future assignments, I have no reservations
or specisl recuests. I am willing and grepared to travel to any area
consistent with my qualifications, Generally speaking, ad for obvious
security reasons, I am interested in getting out of the Central America-
Caribtean area if rossible, It may be recalled that I was denied an Argentine
visa in 1953, for purely technical reasons. This situation: may be changed,
and I would not be opposed to a tour in Argentina, Chile, or any of the South
American republics. In this matter, the nature of the new project or
assignrent would take precedence with me over personal preferences as to
particular area of assignment, .

kL. Regarding my cover status: I entered Cuba in 1954 under student
cover (Pan American Foundation Scholarship), and as it becane increasingly
more difficult to maintain owing to student disturbences, I completed a
course in the writing of free-lance fiction and am thrice published. This
writing has been used as a realistic, s a@p cover, even after I wag
provided with a notional business cover (rebiie Surveys Institute) ty Read-
quarters, I understand that journalism is considered a weak and tine-vorn
cover; yet if it is worled at, and financially managed through a PRORIKE

checking account, it not only satisfies local SS probes bat it does not have  -

the inherent disadvantages inwlved in setting up a full-fledged business
cover. I set this out as a possible suggestion to Headcuarters, but have
no insistence as to Journalistic over’ business cover. The notional
business cover provided me has Proved satisfactory in a limited sense thus
far, end even utilized as cover for action occasionally, bat I would be
uncertain about introducing it in a less "Americanized country than Cuba,

A Wemoranche of 8 Hovenber 1955, reported that Subject had approached -
a KDAE representative on 30 September. 1955, at which time ha requested
guidmce and possible financial assigtance for a proposed business :
arrangenont with Peter HIRALULMEC, former Yugoelav Assistant Military
Attache in Washington, and now Chief of the Foreign iivision of PUTNIK,

} representative that KUBARK would naitncr give him financial aseistance
nor influence in any way his personal decision in the matter,

da, Also the files reflect that Subject has had contacts with other
purchasing agente for foreign countries: In MANA 2217, 19 March 1957,
Subject and Isaac Cohen, Israeli purchasing agent in New York, visited
Nicaragua ostensibly to discuss the purchase of Isracli corvettes by

Stated that Abdul Rachman SURTOKUSINO, djakarta, Inaonesia, connec tea
with the Indonesian Police Force, had been in tha U.S, in the early
' part of 1956 seeking arms for Indonesia, Due to U.S. regulations, be
. Wee unable to obtain arms. At this time Subject interested SURTOKUSIAD
in purchasing aras from the Dominican Republic, According to source,
Subject and SURIOXUSUMO made a trip to the Dominican Republic in Juns
1956 accom-anied by a U.S. arms expert and Xarique Garcia, Jn, who
had claimed to be a personal friend of Gen, Rafael L. Trujillo of
the Dominican Republic and who is registered with the Foreign Agents
Registration Section, listing his foreign principal as the Dominican
Republic. It was reported in H1MA 0923, 6 Angust 1956, that Subject

negotiated the subsequent sale of 30 of these vehicles to Cuba.
Recently Subject approached U.S. officials in Mearagua re disposal
of 20 of these vehicles to the Guatamalan Government,

e@. The only reference to MIRAVELIN reflected in this name check
was a KUJUMP report dated 22 April 1957 which stated that a letter,
found by a law enforcemnt officer in February 1957 among MIRAYLIN's
personal effects, seemed to imply that a joint effort was being made
by MIRA‘ELIN and the late Nicaraguan president SOW2A to open a casing
in Nicaragua, This letter dated 27 August 1956 was written on the
letterhead of the Nicaraguan Government Agency, Suite 122), Wyatt

SNAP-ON SIGHT HOOD FOR
THE 7.62 BELGIUM (FAL) RIFLE

pros

|

1. The sight hood snaps over the existing rear sight on .
the 7.62 Belgium (FAL) rifle. It is designed to raise the rear
Sight to compensate for the more curving trajectory of the under-
loaded ammunition and is an open sight for increased night sighting ;
capability. -

2. The sight hood is oriented with the three screws facing
the muzzle end of the rifle (See attached drawings). Press
down on the hood until the ball detent snaps into the peep hole

so that the hood will fit firmly in place, If it fails to fit,

file the existing rear sight as necessary. If the sight fits

the slot but is difficult to snap on and off, or is too loose,

2. On 15 and 16 Juhe 1964, the undersigned and Mr, Bob
Ricker, T3D/SDB went to Isolation to test an open sight hood for
: the 7.62mm Belgium (FAL) Rifle developed in answer to Ref. A.
i The Modified Willians peop sight developed previously in answer
i to Ref. A and reported on in Ref. B. proved unsatisfactory to the
: ' requester, The snap-on 6ight hood was then Geveloped on a quick
reaction basis to bo sizpler to install and easier to use than
- the Williams sight. In addition scna improved underloaded 7.62:m
KATO rounds having e@oft. annealed cases and crease of wheat filler
. Were tested for performance. These vere developed in hopes of

tho erratic commision psrferassce, 00406 .48. Ref «,Be..:x,-: —

‘ 2. The open sight hood Snaps over the existing rear sight
_ Of the PAL rifle, and in theory makes shooting in poor light or
8% Bight easier. It can be used with either atandard factory
:.-1.- + loads or the underloaded asmunition in conjunction with the muzzle
to ‘attachment silencer. The notch on the rear eight hood is "U" shaped
. and raised to compensate for the nore curving trajectory of the low
. Velocity ammunition. The hood is easily detached making the con-

*: wentional peep sight evailable any tine it is desired. -.

i
“3. The attached data sheet suznarizes the test results. It.

vas found that some familiarization vas necessary to get used to
am thd open sight. Under ideal conditions the sight was as easy to :
- Use as the poop sight although it was nore difficult to maintain %
uniform vertical grouping. The relationship botween the eye and
. Year sight was found to be very critical. As the tests proceeded - .
& change was noted in the point of impact ws. point of aim which was |

ee teeter

ao ane

thought to be due to a change in sight picture on the part of the
undersigned, : Oe

: 4. The improved axsunition was found to be quite consistant :
in performance. The use of crean of wheat filler to tamp the powder at
charge against the primer was ag attempt to get mors even ignition =
‘ith correspondingly improved accuracy. The expended cartridge
_ C8868 Were checked periodically and no evidence vis.found of the: ~- | - +
soft ennealed cases not expanding properly. During the teste the ~
\ : wile and azwunition conbination iastilled a dogree of confidence

in the undersigned not present in the previous teste.

S. Tests were conducted in the evening to determine the degree
of usefulness of the sight in poor light. In this respect a 22
Caliber Hi-Standard pistol with folding shoulder stock and Bushnell
1.3X Phantom scope waa tested in comparison. The scope was
equipped with yellow filters to brighten the sight picture for
: low light level use. It was the opinicn of both test personnel :
i-- +. 2. that the scope was superior to either the peep sight or open aight Le
: foz as long as their vas some illumination on the silhouctte .
targets. Once the light failed the scope was completely useless
although the undersigned could still discern targats with the naked
eye out to 50 yds, All actual shooting was done with the open
: Sight and some difficulty was experienced in hitting the targets
: at ranges of 100 yds. or sore even at dusk. The closer targets
. could be easily hit up until it becass too dark to seo them at all.
A large rain cloud poving from behind the firing position gradually
. obscured all available light. For the final shooting at 25 yds.
.’ | @€easional lightning flashes gave only a vague awareness of the
_, target location. At no time during the night trials was there an
7 " mugele flash visible fro= the under loaded ammunition and muzzle z
' pYlencer combinatios. @ g&5 por was '@ O©2 position
luring @ day Tials was turned on at night but no flash was
visible at the breech. A fine white cloud of cream of wheat
povder was visible in front of the muzzle at almost full darkness
- but could not be seen sore than 30 feet avay. .

6. Listener trials were conducted the following day to deter-
Sine bow far away an alert listener could discern the mechanical
‘ poise of the mechanism and that of the round being fired. Mr. Ricker
Walked away downwind at an sagle of 90 degrees to the line of fire
and stopped to listen every 25 paces. The undersigned fired
_ Single rounds, (hand actuating the nechanise) each time Nr. Ricker
y Stopped, At 325 paces, or roughly 275 yds., Er. Ricker reported. _..;;
he could still hear the mechaniss being actuated, the round being.
fired, and the bullet striking a concrete pillar 200 yds. down-~
range, However, he stared that he might not have noticed the sound
at that range had he not been listening for it specifically. :

* %, One of the major causes for concern at the start of the
tests was that the cream of wheat filler sight clog the silencer
and render it ineffective. A total of 200 rounds were fired with
the silencer in plsce and the noise level did seem to be higher at
, the finish of the second day. (Round numbers 180 to 200 were the . :
ones expended during the previously nentioned listener trials). nt
Inspection of the silencer at a later date revealed considerable a
cream of wheat residue in the screening. Sound level measurements
Bade in the AMF sound lab showed that while the total noise levei

". was no higher, the duration was relatively longer, This would

make the silencer seem louder to near by observers but not increase  —
the range at which it could be heard. However, from a stand-
" point of tho ability for a listener to discrininate a a@ilencer
being fired from random noise, the longer duration gives hin a
better chance to recognize what he hears.

8. On 19 June 1964, the undersigned vent to the warehouse
at Franconia to try to fit the sight hood to other 7.65mm FAL
rifles, It was suspected that the fit might be a problem when it
would not fit over the rear sighta of three FAL rifles at Isolation.
Although it was later determined that the throe rifles.vere of a
daifferent lot and say therefore have different tolerances on the
rear sight casting, it was felt that further checking was necessary.
Mine PAL rifles from the sane lot as those obtained by WH/SA/MOB/PY
were unpackaged and the sight hood tried on the rear sight. Of
the nine, two were perfect fits and the other seven too thick .
for the hood to fit. This created a problem in that the sight
hoods bad to fit rifles which for operational reasons could not be
measured before hand to determine the thickness of the rear sight
blade. Providing adjusteent in the slot of the sight hood would
have complicated the fixture to the point where it could becoze
operationally unsuitable. Therefore it was determined that the
best solution was to provide several small files with the hoods.
The peep sight on the rifles, & soft casting, was found to be
quite easy to file. In most cases it would be necessary only to
file several thousandths to obtain a proper fit. This procedure
was explained to B/FM and he stated that it would be

acceptable. : . oo

OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY

A. Preparations vere underway in early November to
dispatch AMTRUNK-13 to Madrid in mid~Novenber to cement
the recruitment of AKTEUNK-19. These plans fell
through when the Madrid Station notified Headquarters
and WAVE thet their workload would not allow sufficient
case officer time to handle AMTEUNK~13 in Madrid at this
time. WAVE agreed to postpone ANTEUNK~13's trip to
Madrid several weeks until Madrid Station's workload
abated somewhat.

B. The prospects of finalizing the recruitment of
ANTRUKK~-19 increased however with the receipt at WAVE

of another open letter from AMTRUNK-19, this one

mailed from Mexico City in mid-November. 11 ANTRUNE-19'g
first letter, mailed from Nontrenl in mid-October, he
suggested using a friend in Nexico City as a cut-out to
initiate a channel of communications between himself and
ANTRUNE~13. In his second letter, AMTRUNK-19 stated
that be had made the necessary arrangements with his
friend in Mexico. Although WAVE, Headquarters and VEX
traces on ANTRUNE~19's friend, IDEN A, were fragmentary,
Mexico Station stated that IDEN A vas well-known to one
of its PBRUMEN assets who vouched for IDEN A's loyalties.
WAVE intends to send an innocuous letter to AMTRUNE~-19 in
ANTRUNK-13's handwriting to keep the channel with 4-19
alive. AMTRUNK-19 appears eager to see ANTRUNK~13 again
and has stated in both letters that he has considerable
information to discuss in detail. It is well realized
that this open letter channel ia far from ideal but it
is hoped that in early January 1965 ANTRUNK-13 can re-
contact AMTRUNK~-19 and provide hia with a system of S/t.

MHAPHOM requirements upon bin.

C. In mid-Novenber after the postponement of AMTRUNK-13's
Madrid trip, preparations began to launch Operation
PMTEEEE XY in car’y Peceaber. This operation sould attexpt
to re-organize the ratline to and from Havana and the
ANTRUNK infil area for the future use of infiltrated
MHAPRON recruiters and other agent assets ag necessary.
Secondary objectives are to bring into the tufil area

a@ cache of weapons and explosives for AMTRUNK-10/AMLASH~1
and to teach a system of S/W to one or more assets in the
area. The team is to be composed of the same four individ-
uala who participated in Operation ANTEUNK 1X in October
1964; AHAGRKE-1, Team Leader; ABAKA-1, Radio Operator;
and AHTRUWK~16 and -20, Guides. It sas decided tv sheive
the V-20 as the Intermediate Craft (IC) for this opera-
tion and substitute a 17' Johnson boat with twin 75 hp.
outboard motors which could maneuver through shallower
water and which could be more easily camouflaged. The
basic reason for this decision was the fact that Decen~
ber through February are the low-water months in the
AMTRUXK operational area. During this shallow water
season, the heavier, wider Y-20 can only be used in the
daecper and sore heavily-guarded infiltration canals.

D. Through the combined efforts of AMICE-14, the AMTRUKK
P/A, and AMAGRER~1 and AMAKA-1, four radio operator
candidates, to be trainod for future use in PH opura~
tions, were recruited during the reporting period.

B. Recruiting for MHAPRON infiltration candidates con~
tinued during the reporting period. One prospectivo
Anfiltree was recruited during the month of November

and the case officer was active in assessing and debrief-
ing two other candidates. It is hoped that by Harch 1965
one or more of these candidates will be trained and pre-
pared for infiltration for clandestine MUAPRON recruit-
ing. Ip lerge measure this will depend upon the success
of Operation AMTRUNK XK in re-organizing the ratline to
and from Havana.

F. S/®¥ Weesnage No. 13 was sent to ANTRUNK-l1 in response
to his Nessage No. 15 in which he stated that both OWVL
receivers were now in his possession. ¥AVE Measage No.
13 to AMTHUNK~11 gave directions for the disposition of
the OWVL receivers and the activation of OWYL contact
with both AMTRUNK~-11 and ANTBUNK-10.

SUBJECT: Meeting with AMLASH-1 in Paris,

|
MEMORANDUM POR THE RECORD |
i

@. The primary reason for again meeting AMLASH~1

“ before hie planned return to Cuba was to brief him on the ro

i security implications Anvolved in the infiltration and j

4 possible capture of Modesto Orlando Orozeo Basulto AKA t

: Bebo Orozco, who infiltrated into cuba on 21 Dec 1964, ‘4
Orozco, according to his ‘fe, went to Cuba to rescue Jose i
Vasquez .Horey and three others who were hiding in the. of

, home of a woman named Gloria Cabrera, who lived at No. 72 Ly
27th Street, between N & O, Apartment 3, Vedado, Havana. xt
Orozco's capture, if he has been captured, presents an bs

a indirect threat to the security of AMLASH-1 and a more

ut direct threat to the security of AMTRUNK-10 since Orozeo

: in Jan 1964 exfiltrated through the rat line established

" by AMICE-14 (Miguelito), Upon his return to Cuba,

ca AMLASH-1 will check the above vith AMTRUNE-10; and, i¢

still in hiding, r¢ the letter to UNSHAFU-9 mentions a

~~ : good and pleasant return trip, this will mean that Orozco
is not under the control of the Security service. If the
letter talks aboutA long, tiring trip, this Will indicate
that Orozeo has been arrested. AMLASH-1 was also requested
to send a report on the above and any complications which
have developed or may develop from Orozco's infiltration.

raasee

b. AMLASH-1 Suggested that his nom de guerre "Charles,"
which we have been using for the. past three years, be
changed to "Gerardo."

business partner) in Geneva or Rome, AMWHIP.) vas briefed —
to inform Ventura that any letters he received from

i Venturz to forward to New York any letter received from

H Cuba addressed to him and signed by a person unknown to

a been put down for him in Matanzas. He repeated what he

H i the questions in the WAVE cable, A cable on this subject
was sent from Paris to Headquarters, info WAVE, on 2 Feb,

how much of the radio equipment and other material had
been recovered from the cache,

i ©. AMLASH-1 was asked 4f he knew of any individual in
Cuba whom he could recruit and who could be inserted into
4 the Cuban Intelligence Service with the idea of attempting

president and that his man, Laghro Mora, would be one of
the vice-presidents, (A cable on this subject was sent
to Headquarters from Paris.)

g. AMLASH-1 was requested to check with Fizzolo
regarding the precautions being taken to prevent sabotage
of the lodkotives being shipped from France to Cuba;
eBpecifically, how carefully do they check the placement
of the seals, are they special seals or regular load
seris, are there going to be any additional checks once
the locomotives reach Cuba, will they drain the of11 and
lubricants from the factory to the port, and do they run
the locomotives under their own power or are they towed.
AMLASB~1 agreed to attempt to develop answers to the above
requirements and pass the information to his contact in
the Paris Station. AHMLASH-1 also agreed to attempt to find
out and pass to the Paris Station through UNSNAFU-9 the
names of the Cuban techs training at La Rochelle,

h. In a general discussion regarding the persons with
whom AHLASH-1 had been in contact either personally or
through letters, AMLASH-1 mentioned Alfredo Portela,
AHLASH-1 stated he had received a letter from Portela and
had in turn written to Portela. He considers Portela a
friend which was the only reason for writing to him.

5 i, AMLASH-1 was debriefed on Cuban Intelligence
Service personnel. A cable on this subject was sent fron
Paris to Headquarters.

j. <A cable was sent from Paris to Readquarters
suggesting WAVE send a S/W letter to AMTRUNK-10 stating:

k. AMLASH-1 was asked for information on the fol-
lowing persons:

(1) Samuel Gonzalez Rodriguez-Planes. AMLASH-1
reports he is a member of the Ameijeiras group and
is a good and brave man,

(2) Antonio Lusson y Batlle, Chief of Operations
of the General Staff of the Occidental Army.
AMLASH-1 reports Lisson if an independent and rare
type individual who keeps to himself and doesn't
involve himself in political matters. AMLASH-1 has
heard nothing bad about Lusson,

the Cuban Embassy in Madrid and one of the security
people, He was formerly assigned to Brazil, is young

conditions. AMLASH-1 states there are no real problems,
although the scarcity and lack of a balanced diet do
cause some problems. The purification of water has been

. & problem which probably has been the cause of some of the
sickness in the country. —_—

m. AMLASH-1 did not believe that Aragones had invited
him to fly back to Havana with him tn order to get him
back because of eny serious security matter. AMLASH-1
did state that Aragones was concerned that AMLASH-1 may not
return to Cuba. Since Aragones cleared AMLASH-1 for his
trip abroad, he is in a way responsible that AMLASH~1 does
not defect and returns to Cuba. AMLASH~1 feels Aragones
does not want any problems with Fidel in case AMLASH-1
decides to stay out.

nm. AMLASH-1 was unable to provide any information on
the political developments in Cuba in mid-November and
December since he had been out of the country since early
November. AMLASH-1 was asked to check on the problems
between the opposing factions in the Cuban leadership and
explained the issues, the background and personalities
involved. -

H : p. Rank of Cuban officials under Fidel in teras of
I their influence in making national policy, Rseul is still
the heir apparent to Fidel. Next to Raul is Che Guevara,

After that, no other official, according to AMLASH-1, has
any great influence in the making of Cuban national policy,
President Dorticos’ relationghip with Fidel is gvod since
be is a hard and serious worker, has good administrative
ability and is able to work within the general outline laid
down by Fidel, Raul Castro has sone political influence |
and control in Oriente where he has placed his men in i
positions of influence, but only Fidel personally has any
poktical influence in the rest of Cuba, Even within the
military Fidel selects and appoints high army officers.
Che Guevara is still strong in the economic field and
has not suffered a decline in his influence and authority
because of his earlier policy of industrialization,
Guevara restricts himself to the economic field and plays
@ very small role in the political field. He is serious
and very hard worker, one of the few, according to AMLASH-1,
who has worked geven days a week without leave since the
revolution, Emilio Aragones holds an important pos{tion
as the organizational secretary of the PURS. He is the
official who was always at the office of the National
Directorate of the Party and has contact with all the
officials in the regime, He plays an important coordinating
role, Faure Chomon has been.accused of organizing former
13th of March Revolutionary Directorate people, but,

. according to AMLASH-1, this probably based on the fact that
Chomon always gives jobs in the ministry he heads to DR
people, Because of this Chomon today controls to 3 large
degree the Hinistry of Transportation. Of all the ainistries,
the DR's stronghold is in the Ministry of Transportation.
Other DR people who continue to hold important positions

“ in the regime are Alberto Kora, Ambassador Carrillo and
Jose Naranjo. a

specifics, but from their conversations with Ambassador
Carrillo got the impression that Carrillo would prefer and
_ Welcome a transfer from the Eabassy in Paris to the

- _¥. According to Emilio Aragones, Anibal Escalante
is being considered for a job outside Cuba. The job will
probably be in the commercial/economic field, but a
decision had not been made as of November 1964 as to
location. ,

S&. AMLASH-1 sgain reported that he feels Orlando i
Blanco, Consul of the Cuban Embassy in Bern, is :
approachable since he is unhappy with the Cuban regime,

| AMLASE-1 also feels that Enrique Rodriguez Loeches,

| Cuban Ambassador in Pabat, is approachable if approached :
and developed by the right person. Marina Garcia Gonzalez
assigned to the commercial section of the Cuban Embassy
in Rabat, AMLASH-1 feels is also approachable and feels
money can be used as an inducement. Ambassador Carrillo,
AHLASH-1 feelea, if the proper person developed him, could

robably be compromised with Fidel, He is a charact:

could easil ° SH-1 in :
& compromising situation, Ambassador Carrillo is a close

2. AMLASH-1 was also asked information on a long list
of other requirements on Cuba. On many he was unable to pro-
vide information and cables were sent to Headquarters on the
requiresents on which he did provide information.

PROJECT OUTLINE

1

‘Mexico City, Mexico. ‘support for singleton ‘contract agent
operating into right-wing political milieu in Mexico for
intelligence purposes with some covert action by-product.

2. Objectives
a. Objective The objective of this project is to provide

support for a U.S. contract agent who has access to a wide variety
of right-wing political elements and organizations in Mexico.

b. Conduct of Project The contract agent, LIHUFF/1, was born
in Mexico and has had a long history of business experience in
Latin America, as well as, over the past fifteen years,, in Mexico.
At the present time, he is Executive Director of U.S. Chamber of
Commerce of Mexico City, which gives him a great deal of mobility !
in both American and Mexican business circles. Generally, it is :
from the Mexican business community that the financing and support
for right-wing political movements, organizations, and institutions

manipulation of the economic life of the country, the Mexican
businessmen continue to support right-wing political movements or
ostensibly nonprofit civic, research, and other types of organiza-

their philosophy and taking-action in the politico-cconomic fields.
LIHUFF/1 has natural access through his present position and past
extensive experience in the business community here. Over the
years, as a matter of fact, hs numerous associations with these
elements have earned him their trust and respect. In a vacauon AE :
the past four years he has funded Lic. Agustin NAVARRO Vasquez UFF/
organization, consisting primarily of Instituto de Investigaciones
4
!

eeeteseabe Slt that

earned

Sociales y Economicos, A.C. (IISE), "Espejo" (a magazine on
politico-economic affairs), and Movimiento Universitario de
Renovadora Orientacion (MURO, a student organization). Also, he
has handled LICHANT/1 who has a history of, and numerous associa-.
tions in, the Mexican right-wing political arena. These and many
other contacts of this type will provide the basis for his reports
on this particular segment of the political spectrum in Mexico.

and MURO, but Hugo SALINAS Price, Jorge. SIFGRIST Clamont and numerous
others of political significance on the Mexican scene. In connection

“from Headquarters, is somewha: of a priority requirement.

posite

a

the Ministry of Education and other aspects of the Mexican

. d. RMD, This project is responsive to Priority A3d

City (approved October 1963). This priority reads in part:
“obtain Information on the stability of the Government ...
through high-level penetrations and through surveillances and
controlled assets of other powerful political groups such as
the Frente Civico... and through continued development and
influencing of high-level government contacts." As an
ancillary measure, the project could contribute to MHSPAWN
objectives of the RMD under certain circumstances where use
of right-wing platforms ana urganizations is merited.

3. Background,
oa, Developments Leading '.9 to Project,

(1) Mexico, politically, is a country in which, _
increasingiy, a centrist political concensus is developing
based on the impact of education and economic development.
On elther side though of this growing central political
spectrum are extreme ‘left and extreme right wings which are

out of proportion to-their numbers. Political disturbances
and efforts to induce jack of stability eminate in the main
from these two extreme wings. As the centrist force grows
slowly, it is possible and probable. that these two wings will
intensify their efforts and become more and more radical.
The Station has intelligence coverage of the extreme left-
wing, but has neglected the equally. important extreme ‘right-
wing when, in the final analysis, any threat to Mexican
political stability by fomenting unrest and incidents does,
and will continue to, eminate from the right-wing as well as

be pena ten ae Sy

RMD, the long range national policy objectives of the U.S.
toward Mexico are to encourage a stable democratic government
and political environment, then coverage of the right-wing

is required if for no other reason than meeting normal Station
responsibilities for political reporting. HBFINCH contacts
inthis area have been, and probably will continue to be,
virtually nil, ‘In fact, .at present in this area HBF INCH
contacts are non-existent.

(2) LIHUFF/1 was first picked up as a contact by
Station Mexico City in 1950’ after having been a contract
agent for Station Panama City for some three years (while

_relationship of one degree or another with. this Station
ever since then. This relationship developed from "contact"
_ into formal contract status in November 1962. LIHUFF/! has ot
.f: > handled Station congtacts and activitics with LIHUFF /2 ; i:
rst as well as LICHANT/) from 1962 to date. In
“.., addition, he has done a good deal of reporting on right-wing
activities from other sources and other contacts of his. i
Subsidy of the LIHUFF activity for MHSPAWN purposes ” a [
wiley . will be terminated effective
30 June 1965. Use of LICHANT/1 will be continued in an ;
intelligence reporting capacity and,in a limited way, for |. |
.

covert action efforts.

b. Prior Negotiations. There have been no prior
negotiations with the Mexican Government, intelligence or
security services, or ODYOKE elements on this project.
LIHUFF/1 has been used in the past, prior to his contract
with KUBARK, as a source by ODIBEX and ODMARK.

: 1. ; c. .Relationship to Other Projects. This project
i has no relationship to any other Station project. .

d. Utilization of Same Operational Assets,
_ LIHUFF/1 has not beenutilized:on any other project, past. or
present, except to the extent|he was involved with the LIHUFF

\ - activity Indicated-in subparagraph 3a(2) above.

4. Qperational Assets. -.
- a. Personnel. .

: (1) LIHUFF/1 (OA granted on 10 October 1962

soe with no number forwarded to field) -- Subject was born in

Poy oe Mexico, is fluent in Spanish, and is about 49 years old.

me Since World War II, he has been in private business in Latin
America, first in Panama and then in Mexico from 1950 on.
During World War II, he was in Army intelligence in China and,
therefore, had an understanding of covert operations prior to
his KUBARK experience. While in Panama, he was employed by
the Station there for several years " to organize a net
directed against a target of high priority interest", This
association was terminated by reason of his move to Mexico
for business reasons. Although he was in contact with this
Station virtually from his time of arrival in Mexico, he was
not picked up as a contract agent until November 1962. His
cover for his past and proposed activities has been natural:
that of a businessman with a conservative political outlook
and interested in the economic and political posture of- the

‘

j
|

Mexican Government. Contact with him is covered by a socfal
oa relationship between his case officer and.himself; this is
ns easily maintained. given the large American community in Mexico
ot City. He hes had no formal intelligence training other than
rat . that he received from the Army during World War Il and on the
° job with KUBARK. Control of Subject is no problem inasmuch
: as he is an American citizen and has had considerable
oo oe = *"™" "experience with KUBARK by now, His motivation is that of an
; attraction to this type of work, being a U.S. citizen ina
foreign area, natural concern forhis business interests, and,
BO . . probably, the compensatory return from KUBARK. He is witting
of his KUBARK association and, aside from his World War tt
Intelligence experience with ODIBEX, in 1961 he had an
intelligence relationship with. ODIBEX which has long since
-* “.. been terminated. a

: (2) LICHANT/1. (OA granted on 22 April 1963,

: but no number forwarded to field) -- Subject is a ver

an conservative Mexican educator and intellectual about ho years
of age. He has alternated between working in various
capacities for the Government.of Mexico and in Mexican le
universities. At the present’ time, he is Private Secy. in Min.of !Ed.,
position which gives him unique access in the government to a
the general fields of education and politics as well as
considerable contact with other influential people in right«
wing circles... He was recruited by LIHUFF/] in August 1962

on the pretext of doing research work and collecting infor-
mation for LIHUFF/1's general use for business purposes.
Subject has natural cover for obtaining: information on right-
wing activities from others due to his long association with
right-wing activities as a student, educator, and government
servant. Contact between Subject and LIHUFF/1 is maintained
under the guise of private business relationship, Subject has
had no intellicence training from KUBARK other than that
imparted by LIHUFF/1 in discussing his reports. There has
been no problems in control since essentially. Subject under-
stands that this is a business relationship with certain
requirements involved for it to be sustained. Subject's
motivation is that of an intellectual ly-convinced conservative
who has common objectives and outlook with LIHUFF/1 on
political and economic matters plus the financial aspect of
the LIHUFF/1 relationship. Subject is not witting of KUBARK
or ODYOKE interest in his activities and reporting. He has no
known contacts with other intelligence or security services,
past or present. --

5. Security Evaluation, |

In the unlikely. event of compromise, LIHUFF/1 could
. continue to claim that he was not doing anything that hundreds
i Be of other businessmen, U.S. and Mexican, aren't doing as” | :
. - f+. 7 =": . Commonly-accepted practice: trying to influence the. politicos
j Loa bo economic climate. in Mexico for thelr own benefit. Whatever
i a a the extent of the compromise, there would be no repercussion
' . . Snsofar as other operations or activities per se were
Po ee concerned except that there might be some tightening of the
: . general operational climate for a while. If, somehow,
. cee LIHUFF/I's true role were disclosed, he could probably be
: vet backstopped with a minimum of publicity through high-level
i (+ == §tation contacts with the Government (explaining the Statlon
i Interest In right-wing circles as attempting to follow what -
: : : they were up to In case they became a threat to the stabllity
: of the present government).
: 6. Coordination. : a i
i ‘ : No coordination is desirable or required with other
bocnlts ODYOKE or PBPRIME elements, with the Mexican government, or
with other governments and.intelligence services... It Is
‘ ‘ assumed that normal coordination with varlous elements within. ~~
. : KUBARK. Headquarters will take place. ;

a. General, It Is requested that thIs project be
authorized: in the. amount of $9,000 per annum effective  —

i (1) LIHUFF/? salary $3,600.00
: (2) Operattonal Expenses - 3,000.00
(3) Entertainment and Travel 2,400.00

Total per annum $9,000.00
_No non-KUBARK funds will be involved in this activity. |

9. Emergency. Conditions...

If an official anti-USA atmosphere of suffictent :

intensIty prevalled In Mexico, LIHUFF/1 very aie would te

not be able to maintain himself here, particularly if his i
employment continued in his present capacity. . This,
howaver, Is not seen as anything except a very remote contin-
gency due to the Government of Mexico's dependence on the U.S. -
tourist trade. In a general war, it is probable that LUIHUFF/I | _
would be able to continue in place without too much difficulty | -
and would be witting to continue operating on current objectives .
or to undertake entirely new operations against new targets. %
contact and communications should represent few problems In
Mexico.

Methodology:

1. . The portion of the 11 June 1962 tape in question

was provided to two employees, both of whom are professional
’ transcribers and native Russian speakers. Thoy were provided

with the background of the difficulty, i.e.,-that previous
transcriptions. of the tape “quoted Nosenko as saying that
he had "also been in the States" and that ke had used the
alias Nikolayey "both in England and 'u vas* i.e., in the
United States.

_ 2, Mir. Kozlov and Mr. Berest Produced a transcription
which contains no statement of Nosenko's:- saying he had been
in the United States. In addition, their rendering of the
sentence pertaining to Nosenko's use of the alias Nikolayev
reads, with no equivocation, "both in England and tu nNas'",
i.c., “in the Soviet Union." :

3. Independently, the same portion of tape was given
yet another professional transcriber, a native Russian
speaker. She was given no background whatsoever on the
problem. Her transcript contained no statement of Nosenko's
saying he had been in the United States. In addition, her
rendering of the sentence pertaining to Nosenko's use of
the alias Nikolavey reads unequivocally as “both in England
and ‘u nas'", i.e., “in the Soviet Union."

DOr. MIRG oald thers was no way ta determine the accuracy
of the Migures givon of planes, guns, etc. received. jrum the Soviet bloc
{and Raly and Canada) but even tf tha (iguves wore skaggeratod 100 per
cent, thay would still be impressive,

. Ho addod that Castro to daily becoming stronger militarily
with weapons and with a largo militia of lose to 303,059 being trained
to wee them while the sconomy coutinues to deteriorate, ‘erhape only
half the militia wouid be effective. But tuat is eiseable, Thus, de eaid,
the longer tha delay in positive military action to overthrow Castro, the

“greater will be tho task. “"@ mast act soon, vigorously and effectively,
' to fesure victery. Anothsr cofeat would be disastrous and would make
Cubans, Latin Armerléaas and others believe Castro to be invincibia,
Then would come accommmadations and oven worss, the (raplanting of
Castro-becked’ Peygimea in the heriaphere, And tha UL 5S. would sufiez
worst of all, being discredited for defeat and "gullt of laterforence.
“in tue UN na nation wouid stand beside the U, 3."

6. Proposal that Connell ao to Cuba with’ Commando Group and
Eatabligh a Government on Lubaa oadl . :

Dy, MUG thea declared that he v WSS Coavinced that Castro
would never be cverthzown by all tho propaganda, the sobctage, eomuvands

vaids, guerrilla activities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deteriorating

ecanoniy, and that tt. cas inconceivable to. establish a sovernment-hrexile
fox nothing would c:.me of it; that the only aoluilon for defeating the
Castro regime was ior the Revolutionary Cenacil ta go te Cuba and ostab-
lish @ goveramert on Cuban soll, abk recognition by all friendly countries
aad nillitary assistance af tio prireipal ally, the U, £., ond that the Us.
be ready to intervene tmimediately with ts Forces. “This would ail have
tc take place in a matter ci 43 hours, cthrrwise ie would fail. J recognise
that thie is a bold pian, but boldness ie necossary, Thors will be many
Figko, many may ba billed. As for myseli, Idon't care if Idie, have
faat all my e0reonal possessiunn and ray gen isa privoner, ' hie reitesated
that all oust be well prepared in advance, there must be no vaciliation,
everything must proceed rapidly. Firat, a commando raid in feres to
selsa & pisce of Cuban lerritory, groferably near Gaantansmo, sou iosnie-
diately tha members uf the Council xo ashore, proclaim a provisional
government, breadcast by radiv te atl nations an appenl fer reco niticn
(and cables prepared in advance would aloo be went out), requeat U, 5,
aestetance, and the U. 5. should furnish ouch assistance at uvca in ade-

that Castro could be overthrown in Boy other way. Ladrnitted that

ef course bis plan would have to be otudied at the. highest government

Dr. 2:IRO sald there wae no way to detarmine the accuracy
of tho figures given of plaves, guns, otc. received from the Soviet bloc
(end aly and Canada) but even if the figures wero exageratad 100 per
font, they would still be tmpresaive.

: - He added that Castro ta daily becoming stronger militarily
with weapone and with a large militia of close to 300, 060 being trained
to use them while the ecozomy continue to deteriorate. Ferbaps aly
half the militia would be effective, But that is sizeable, Thus, he said,
the Janger the dolay in positive military action to overthrow Castro, the
Greater will be the tash. ‘Wo must act goon, vigorously and effectively,
to ineuro victory. Anothor defeat would be disastrous and would make
Cubans, Latia Arsericans and others believe Castro to be invincible,
Then would come accommodationa and ever worss, the {raplanting of
Castro-bached regizsea in the hoausphere., And the U. S. would suffer
worst of all, being discradited for defeat and ‘“Wguilt of interforence, "'

so

“In tho UN no nation would stand beside the U. 5.

6, Proposal that Council 39 to Cuba with Commando Group and

Establish a Government on Cuban doit

Dr. MIRC then declared that he was ¢oavinced that Castro
weuld never be overthrown by all the propaganda, tho sabotace, commaado
ralde, guerrilla activities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deteriorating
economy, and that it wag inconceivable to establish a governmontdrexile
for nothing would ¢- me of it; that the only solution for defeating tho
Castro regime wap for the Revelutidnary Couacil to Bo to Cuba and estab-
lish a yovernmert on Cuban Boll, ask recognition by all friendly countries
and military assistance of its priminal ally, the U. 4., and that the U.S.
be ready to intervene immediately with its Forces. This would all have
to take place ina matter of 42 hours, otherwise it would fail, I recognize
that thio ts a bold plan, but boldnosg 49 necessary. Thore will be many
risks, many may be killed, As for myoelf, I don’t care if I die, Ihave

- Dr, MIRO asked me what I thought of this Project; did I think

strong military action sppoared necessary. I otatod further that
of course his plan would have to be studied at the highest government

that the U.3. i9 and will be blamed fsr al! anti-Castro Propaganda,

regime established ia the country and helpa it defeat the Covtet-backed
Communist regime, all fzlendly governments will applaud,

“I have no personal political ambitions, ' declared BAO,
“I merely am trying to chair the Council, whose mission is to unify the

channel for {unde and coordinating the activities of groups outside the
Consejo such as the Students, FORD (Labor), ote. » Taaid that I under-
Stood that sore of these eloments were unwilling to function under the
Consejo; and that tn view of that eituation, did he consider that an :
Activity Committee might be organised with a dolegato from each of
these groups and under the chatrmanship of a member of the Consejo,
Thia would sorve to coordinate their activities, give thom a tie-in with
the Consejo, yet not make them subservient to it. Dr. MIRO replied
that this would morely set up cacther Consejo outside of and parallel to
the exiating Consejo, I did not pursue this further, not having enough
background of these organisations to be able to diszuse tho matter.

Dr, MIRO sald there wag no way to determine the accuracy
of the {fgurea given of planes, guns, ete, received from the Soviot bloe
(ond Italy and Canada) but even if.the figuros were exaggerated 100 por
Cont, they would. still ba impressive, ,

He added that Castro is dally bocoming stronger militarily
with weapons and with a largo militia of close to 300, 060 being trained
to use them while the econumy coutinues to deteriorate. Perhaps only
half the militia would be effective. But that is siseable. Thus, he said,
the langer the delay in positive military action to overthrow Castro, the
greater will be the task, “We muet act soon, vigorously and effectively,
to luguro victory. Another defeat would be dieagtroua and would make
Cubans, Latin Americana and others bollave Castro to be Invincible,
Thea would come accommoadstiona and even worse, the implaating of
Castro-backed reytines in the hemisphere. And the U, S. would suffer
worst of all, boing discredited for defeat and “guilt of interference, "
"In tha UN no nation would stand beside the U. 3"

&. Proposal! that Council ¢o to Cuba with Commando Group and
Establish a Government on Cuvan Soil :

Dr. MIRO then doclared that he was convinced that Castro
wouid never be ‘overthrown by all the Propagands, the sabota.s, commaada
valde, guerrilla activities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deteriorating
Sconomy, ard that it was inconceivable to establish a Rove rnme at-ir exile
for nothing would c: me of it, that the only solution for defeating the

. Castro regime waa fer the Revolutionary Council to go to Cuba and estab-

Heb a government on Cuban soll, aak recognition by all iriendly countties
and military aasistance of its priipal ally, the U. 5., and that the UL8,
be veady to intervene immediately with {ta Forces, ‘This would all have
to take place in a cauiter of 48 huurs, otherwise ft would fall, 1 recognise
that this ia a bold plan, but boldness ts necessary, Thore will be many
Fioka, many may be killed. As for myself, i don't care if ldie. Ihave
loat all my personal possessions and my son is & prisoner,’ He reiterated
that all must be well prepared in advanca, there must be no vacillation,
overything muat proceed rapidly, First, a consmando raid in force to
oeino a piece of Cuban territory, preferably noar Guantanamo, and irae.
diately the members of the Counct} go ashore, proclalin a provisional

Before such an action {a unde rtaxen, tae enemy must be
acftened by propaganda, sabotage, raids, underground action, and the
mass uf the people of Cuba must be prepared to accept the provisional
government through-propayanda, increased knowledge of the Council
and ite unifying efforts.

Dr, 1URO asked me what I thought of this project; did I think
that Castro could b¢ overthrown in any uther way. ladmitted that
strong inilitary action appeared nocessary. I stated further that
of course hia plan would have to be studied at the highest povernment
levela, He preposed that he inicht elaborate a pian with hia militar y
collaborators, and I suzy ested that he do thiz so that it might be examined

and considerad,

Dr, MIAO declared that he was conviaced that this Counmuntat
dagzor in the side of the Statea could only be eradicated by such action,
that the U.s, ig and will be blamed for al! anti-Castro propazanda,
sabotage, ete, and that enemy states will dencaace It for intervention
in Cuba, but that if the U. 5. yoee to the ald af a friendly revolutionary
regizae established in the cauntry and helza it defeat the Soviet-backed
Communist regime, ail friendly governments will applaud,

“Lbave no personal political arnbitions, ” declared MiIRC,
“Druerely am trying to chair the Council, whose cisston is to unify the
anti-Cagtro elements inside and gutaide of Cuba, Lf the team isn't cone
sidored effective, then chango the pitcher, But I believe the Counc!l must

vacationing in the U. S, after FRONDIZI's visit); that VILLANUEVA, 8
Secretary of the Argentine Embassy in Cuba was coming to see MIRO
today; and further that he {MIRO) had received a phone call last night

Page 7:
pa

Wake be

from a Spaniard (Nicanor FERNANDEZ) in Buenos Airea, urging MIRO
to go to Buenos Aireo to arouse anti-Caatro sentiment of the poople,
inasmuch as somé Argentine action against Cuba appeared tmminont.
(FERNANDEZ said he had alroady written MIRC a letter.) MIRO oays,
“Gf course, I cannot go. Ihave the Consejo meeting on the 10th,
Furthemmore, Iam going to Now York on October 11th or 12th for the
SIP (Socieded Interamericana de Prensa) meeting and have been allotted
12 minutos to addrésa the mooting. " .

10. MIRO to attend Homage to LACE RDA {Brazilian who
Precipitated QUADKUS' resiynation) on Cetober 15

Dr. MIRO said he planned to remain in New York City (alter
31] and 12 Cctober SIP mesting) unti) October 15th to attend the homage
fox LACERDA, the Governor of Guanabara province in Branil. MIRO
probably will etay at the Park Chambero Hotel, but will advise Clark

of hla location. .

I commented that 1 would probably romain in Washington next
week in view of his plans, but that I might go to New York City to meet
with bim; if so, I would get in touch with him and arrango a meeting

timo and place through Clark,

11. Propayanda Commission

Tasked Dr, MIRO about his ideas on the future organization
and structura of tha Propaganda Commission. He stated that it {a out-
sido the Consejy and rot undor his direct control, although the Council

accountant hag been passing funds to it. He said CAR RILLG had rosigned

as head of Propaganda and that he would like CONTE AGUERO to handle
it. He claimed that MESTRE had not done anything with propaganda,

12. MIRO's Views Relative to Supreme Court Justice or PRIO

being Recognized ag Head of a Provisional Government

Tasked Dr, MIRC if he believed that there were many anti-
Castro Cubans (both in and out of Cuba) who favered PRIC, or the head

of the Supreme. Court to be the provisiona) president if a government were

to bo established on Cuban soll, Ur. MIRO declared that tho revolution
fa a fact, and that practically nobody. wants to go back to any former
Fogime. The people in Cuba would rosist any such poasibility, He do-


Page 8:
14-0000

nounced PRIO's activities againot the Council and ita efforta to unify
the anti-Castro elements, He said that the geople should be given an
opportunity to elect thelr chiof of state after Castro's overthrow and

reestablishment of ordor in the ieland:

13, Cffices of Council (Consejo Revolucionario)

When questioned about hia business and private telephones,
MIRO gaid, “The businegs phone is aleo In my house. I have no office
except in my house, but that phone ia always busy (JEfforson 2-4680),
So uge the othor prone (JEffaraon 4-2751) whan you wish to call me,"

'Y need to have a amall office somowhere away from my home
becauze all tho activities there are driving my wile érasy. 1 want to
find something modest so that no accusation can be made of ostentation -
merely a room for myself, one for my secretary, and ona for meetings,
of the Council, ete. The FRD had a place but at that piace also waa the
proas, the refugee centar, otc, It would not be satisfactory, The FRD
ie now practically dead. It was the forerunner of the Consejo as the
unifying agency of the anti-Castro resistance," :

14, MIRO's Views on Goordinating the Activities of Cther Exile

Groups :

Aftor De, MIRO reiterated his view that he should be the
channel for funds and cocrdinating the activities of groupe outside the
Consejo such as tho Students, FORD (Labor), etc., said that Lunder-~ ~
atood that some of these olementa were unwilling ty function undor the
Canaejo; and that in view of that situation, did he considar that an
Activity Committee might be organised with a delegate from each of
theae groups and under the chairmanship of a member of the Cansejo,
This would serve to coordinate their activities, give thera a tie-in with
the Conoejo, yet not make them subservient to it, Dr. MIRO repliod.
that this would merely vet up ancther Consejo outside of and paraliol to
the existing Consejo. I did not pursue this further, not having enough
background of these organisations to be able to ciscasa the matter

effectively.

15, Telophone Conversation with MIRO on 7 Cctober

3
Before my departure from Miami for Washington on 7 October,
I telephoned to Dr, MIRO [rom the airport. Ho appreciated the call and
eked if I had seen in the morning paper the action takea yesterday by

aes

earcy
: . \
the ALABAU Lawyors' group in proclaiming Julio CARCERAN (ono
of the chiof justices in oxile) aa "President of Cuba at War," He exe
pressed his indignation at this unilateral "political" move by ALABAU
and his adherents among the exiled lawyere, and Judges. Ho added hie
best wishes to 12 and reminded me that ho would probably ge to New
York on October 11th or 12th for the SIP (Sociodad Interamericana deo
Prensa) meeting. I replied that I would appreciate if he would contact
Clark after his arrival to give his location in New York City, and that
Clark might havo a request from me for an appointment with him, if
this seemed dasirable. I suggested that in future phono convereations
I would ba known as JUANITO. He agreed with pleasure that this would
be a good procedure. I wished him Godspeed and he replied likewise

to me,

16. Comment

During these first two meetings I endeavored to eatabilah
myself favorably with Dr, MIRO and thereGre refrained from bringing
up details of budget or opposition to any of his specific proposals.

I listened, ackod various questions, and he talked at length.

In future meetings, after I have gained further background and
havo more policy guidance, | shall be able to discuss with him apecific
iasues and endeavor to reach agresments or compromises, aa may be

required,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD) -————--"

SUBJECT: Meeting with Dr, MIRO Cardona on 6 October

1, Dr. MIRO arrived about 9:50 a.m. for the meeting.we had
set at 10:00; again he was driven by his secretary whom he introduced,
As during the first meeting, she remained outside in the car, -Our
meeting lasted until 12:00 noon,

2. First, Dr. MIRO handed mo a note-in-longhard listing the
topica discussed with me on 5 October, These points are? .

a, Groups conducting propaganda, etc. with Agency support :
should receive their support and be coordinated through the Council. . , ,

‘bo A propaganda campaign should be waged by the Council . ;
aimed at: : ;
(1) Cuba, via a long wave radio station in Key West, ,
(2) Cubans in Miami and other ue S. areas by: :
{a) Subsidizing Diario de las Americas,
(b) Contracting for time on radio stations.

(3) Latin America, with a plan such as the "Operacion
Grieta,"

that they were a

With respe ct to . plan for clandestine operations in Cuba,
he stated that 300 men could be counted upon for commando action, part
of them here, part in Cuba, He reiterated that a commando operation
was essential to bolster morale among the anti-Castro elements in Cuba
and in exile as well as to conduct sabotage that would further weaken °
Cuban economy and the Communist regime. He said that for thia operation
U. S. help would be necessary in providing weapons, ammo, demolitions,

equipment, and funds. He proposed that if this plan was considered to

have merit, that I arrange to have. someone meet with his military men
to work out the details. After all preparations had been made and
materiel provided, etc. the operation would be purely a Cuban affair,
(NOTE: Plan turned over to Thompson at our nm eting at 15:30 on

6 October for transmission, )-

4, Request for Arms, etc, to send to Escambray

Dr,MIRO remarked that over a month ago he had made a request
to Clark for arms for the anti-Castro insurgents in the Escambray, but
to date had heard nothing relative to the request. He commented wryly,
"l ask but never hear an answer." He said that the fighters there should
be supported, Dr. MIRO stated that he had a boat (provided by us) and
a means for delivery of the arms. Osvaldo RAMIREZ is chief of the

Escambray group. ;
COMMENT: Has anything been done about this request?

5. Information on Arms Received by Castro Regime

Dr. MIRO handed me a long report which he said was brought
to him by the Argentine Ambassador to Cuba when the latter came to the
U. S. at the time of President FRONDIZI's visit, He said the Ambassador
would not divulge the source of the information but commented, "You will
know. “

- MIRO said there was no way to determine the accuracy
of the tiguree given of planes, guns, etc, reccived from the Soviet bloc
{and ‘Italy and Canada) but-ever. if the figures were exaggerated 100 per
cent, they would stilt be inipreesive, an

- He added that Castro is daily becoming stronger military
with weapons and with a large militia of close to 300, 000 being trained -
to use them while the economy continues to deteriorate. Perhaps only
half the militia would be effective. But that is sizeable, Thus, he said,
the longer the delay in positive military action to overthrow Castro, the
greater will be the task, ‘We must act soon, vigorously and effectively,
to insure victory, Another defeat would be disastrous and would make
Cubans, Latin Americans and others bolieve Castro to be invincible,
Then would come accommodations and even worse, the implanting of
Castro-backed regimes in the hemisphere, And the U,.S. would suffer.
worst of all, being discredited for defeat and "guilt of interference, ''
"In the UN no nation would etand beside the U. S."

6. Proposal that Council go to Cuba with Commando Group and

Establish a Government on Cuban Soil

Dr, MIRO then declared that he was convinced that Castro
would never be overthrown by all the propaganda, the sabotage, commando
raids, guerrilla activities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deteriorating

economy, -and that it was inconceivable to establish a government-in-exile

for nothing would come of it; that the only solution for defeating the
Castro regime was for the Revolutionary Council to 40 to Cuba and estab-
lisha government on Cuban soil, ask recognition by all friendly countries
and military assistance of its primipal ally, the U, S,, and that the U.S.
be ready to intervene immediately with its Forces, 'This'would all have
to take place in a matter of 48 hours, otherwise it would fail, I recognize
that this is a bold plan, but boldness is necessary, There will be many
risks, many may be killed. As for myself, I don't care if I die. Ihave
lost all my personal possessions and my son is a prisoner.'' He reiterated
that all must be well prepared in advance, there must be no vacillation,
everything must proceed rapidly, First, a commando raid in force to
seize a piece of Cuban territory, preferably near Guantanamo, and imme-
diately the members of the Council go ashore, proclaim a provisional
government, broadcast by radio to all nations an appeal for recognition
{and cables prepared in advance would also be sent out), request U. S,
assistance, and the U, S. should furnish such assistance at once in ade-

quate strength to ensure victory,

: Before euch an action is. undertaken, the enemy must be
- : . softened by propaganda, sabotage, raids, underground action, and the ©
mass of the people of Cuba must be prepared to accept the provisional
+ government through propaganda, increased knowledge of the Council
‘and its # unifying ‘efforts. ; ee

re .. MIRO asked’ me what I thought of this project; did I think

that Castro. could be overthrown in any other way. 1 admitted that ,

strong military action appeared necessary. I stated further that

of course his plan would have to be studied at the highest government

_ levels. He proposed that he might elaborate a plan with his military
ors,and I suggested that he do this so that it might be examined

and considered,

Dr. MIRO declared that he was convinced that this-Communist
| dagger in the side of the States could only be eradicated by such action,
that the U.S, is and will be blamed for all anti-Castro propaganda,
sabotage, etc, and that enemy states will denounce it for intervention’
in Cuba, but that if the U. S. goes to the aid of a friendly revbdlutionary
tegime established in the country and helps it defeat the Soviet-backed
Communist regime, all friendly governments will applaud.
: "I have no personal political ambitions, " declared MIRO,
ny merely am trying to chair the Council, whose mission is to unify the
anti-Castro.elements inside and outside of Cuba. If the team isn't con-
didered effective, then change the pitcher, But I believe the Council must
establish itself on Cuban soil, and soon, Time is against us."""The Punta
del Este agreement will backfire against the U, S, if Castro is allowed
to remain in Cuba. Ina year, after the politicos of the countries re-
ceiving U. S. aid have gotten their hands on U, S. gold, they will say,
‘Thanks to Castro, we got this,' And they will spend it as in the past
with no benefits to the social and economic welfare of the people. "

: 7. Views about the Judges and Lawyers
i RE RE SES One —Swyers

i Tqueried Dr. MIRO as to his views relative to the judges and
lawyers and their future status, He said he hoped that they could all
' reunite and that they could be given assistance as in the past. He de-
clared that Dr. ALABAU.was not qualified to be a justice and that he was
doing nothing but making politics and trying to discredii the Council
and MIRO and VARONA. Dr. MIRO declared that he, as Prime Minister
' in the early days of the Caetro government, had named ALABAU to the -

euuis


Page 5:
BN BOE al,

Pa

aN

Supreme Court,’ but that now he considered ALABAU ug
Judicial position.

8. Members of the Revolutionary Council

Dr, MIRO remarked that he had a meeting of the Council on
10 October. I asked what elements now composed it and what he pro-
posed to add. He named the following as presently in the Consejo:

Rescate . \
30 de Noviembre \
Accion Demoeratica_ _ . \
20 de Mayo ; ,
AAA Independiente \
Montecristi

He said he had invited to join:

MRP
Unidad Revolucionaria

and awaited their reply.

He would also like. 6 have the ‘Workers, Students, and the
Professionals (Doctors, Lawyers, ¢tc.) come into the Council. He be-
lieves Batistianos and Comunistas and elements unwilling to cooperate
should be excluded, but that all other groups should be brought together
under the Council.

He contends that all anti-Castro activities, except clandestine
and military, should be coordinated by members of the Council, but that
the excepted activities should be known only to him (MIRO).

9. Probable Argentine Rupture of Relations with Cuba

Dr, MIRO declared that he believed imminent the Argentine
rupture of relations with Cuba. He said the Argentine Ambassador to
Cuba {Juho AMOEDO) was ordered to return to Havana (he had been
vacationing in the U. S. after FRONDIZI's visit); that VLILLANUEVA, a
Secretary of the Argentine Embassy 1n Cuba was coming to see MIRO
today; and further that he (MIRO) had received a phone call last night

' ‘from.a Spaniard (Nicanor FERNANDEZ) in Buenos Aires, urging MIRO
to go to Buenos Aires to arouse anti-Castro sentiment of the people,
le. . -inasmuch as some Argentine action against Cuba appeared imminent,
cos {FERNANDEZ said he had already written MIRO a letter.) MIRO saya,
: . "Of course, I cannot go. Ihave the Consejo meeting on the 10th,
Furthermore, Iam going to New York.on October 11th or 12th for the
SIP (Socieded Interamericana de Prensa) meeting and have been allotted
12 minutes to adares' the meeting," :

MIRO to attend Homage to LACERDA (Brazilian whe
Precipitated QUADROS' resignation) on October 15

Dr, MIRO aaid he planned to remain in New York City (after
11 and 12 October SIP meeting) until October 15th to attend the homage
for LACERDA, the Governor of Guanabara province in Brazil, MIRO
probably will stay at the Park Chambers Hotel, but will advise Clark

of his location,

I commented that I would probably remain in Washington next
week in view of his plans, but that I might go to New York City to meet
with him; if 80, I would get in touch with him and arrange a meeting
time and place through Clark.

11. Propaganda Commission

lasked Dr. MIRO about his ideas on the future organization
and structure of the Propaganda Commission, He stated that it is out-
side the Consejo and not under his direct control, although the Council
accountant has been passing funda to it. He said CABRILLO had resigned
as head of Propaganda and that he would like CONTE AGUERO to handle
it. He claimed that MESTRE had not done anything with propaganda,

12, MIRO's Views Relative to Supreme Court Justice or PRIO
being Recognized as Head of a Provisional Government

lasked Dr, MIRO if he believed that there were many anti-
Castro Cubans (both in and out of Cuba) who favored PRIO, or the head
of the Supreme Court to. be the provisional president if a government were
to be established on Cuban soil.- Dr. MIRO declared that the revolution
is a fact, and that practically nobody wants to go back to any former
regime, The people in Cuba would resist any such possibility. He de~



Page 7:

te

nounced PRIO's activities against the Council and its efforts to unify
the anti-Castro elements, He said that the people should be given an
opportunity to elect their chief of state after Castro's overthrow and
reestablishment of order in the island, |

, 13. Offices of Council (Consejo Revoluciona rio}

When questioned about his business and private telephones,
MIRO said, "The business phone is also in my house, I have no office
except in my house, but that phone is always busy (JEfferson 2-4680).
So use the other phone (JEfferson 4-2751) when you wish to cal) me."

"I need to have a small office somewhere away from my home
because all the activities there are driving my wife crazy. I want to
find something modest so that no accusation can be made of ostentation -
merely a room for myself, one for my secretary, and one for meetings.

of the Council, etc. The FRD had a place but at that place also was the .

press, the refugee center, etc, It would not be satisfactory. The FRD
is now practically dead. It was the forerunner of the Consejo.as the
unifying agency of the anti-Castro resistance, "'

14; MIRO's Views on: Coordinating the Activities of Other Exile
Groups :

After Dr, MIRO reiterated his view that he should be the
channel for funds and coordinating the activities of groups outside the
Consejo such as the Students, FORD (Labor), etc., I said that I under-
stood that some of these elements were unwilling to function under the-
Consejo; and that in view of that situation, did he consider that an
Activity Committee might be organized with a delegate from each of
these groups and under the chairmanship of a member of the Consejo,
This would serve to coordinate their activities, give them a tie-in with
the Consejo, yet not make them subservient to it, Dr, MIRO replied
that this would merely set up another Consejo outside of and parallel to
the existing Consejo, I did not pursue this further, not having enough
background of these organizations to be able to discuss the matter
effectively. . j

15, Telephone Conversation with MIRO on 7 October

Before my departure from Miami for Washington on 7 October,
I telephoned to Dr, MIRO froin the airport, He appreciated the call and
asked if 1 had seen in the morning paper the action taken yesterday by

fart

Gracies

os “ore . —-

the ALABAU Lawyers’ group in proclaiming Julio CARCERAN (one

of the chief justices in exile) as "President of Cuba at War." He ex~
pressed his indignation at this unilateral "political" move by ALABAU
and his: adherents among the exiled lawyers and judges. He added his
best wishes to me and reminded me that he would probably go to New
York on October 11th or 12th for the SIP (Sociedad Interamericana de
Prensa) meeting. I replied that I would appreciate if he would contact

. Clark after his arrival to give his location in New York City, and that

Clark might have a request from me for an appointment with him, if
this seemed desirable. I suggeated that in future phone conversations.
I would be known as JUANITO, He agreed with pleasure that this would
be a good procedure, I wished him Godspeed and he replied likewise
tome. — : . -

16. Comment
During these first two meetings I endeavored to establish
myself favorably with Dr, MIRO and therefore refrained from bringing
up details of budget or opposition to any of his specific proposals,
I listened, asked various ,uestions, and he talked at length.

In future meetings, after I have gained further background and

’ have more policy guidance, I shall be able to discuss with him specific

issues and endeavor to reach agreements or compromises, as may be
required.

‘ specifically, how carefully do they check the placement - j

seals, are there going to be any additional checks once :
the locomotives reach Cuba, will they drain the of] and i
‘lubricants from the factory to the port, and do they run .
the locomotives under their own power or are. they towed. :
AMLASH-1 agractd to attempt to develop answers to the above

Frequirenents and paes the information to his contact in

names of the-:Cuban techs, tyaioing at La ‘Rochelle,

h. In a general discussion regarding the persons with
whom ‘AMLASH-1 had heen in contact either personally or
through letters, AMLASH-1 mentioned Alfredo Portela.
AMLASH-1 stated he hdd received a letter from Portela and
had in turn written to Portela. He considers Portela a

“friend which was the only reason for writing to him. -

k, AMLASH-1 was asked for information on ‘the fol-
lowing persons:

(1) Samuel Gonzalez Rodriguez-Planes, AMLASH-1
reports he is a member of the Ameijeiras group and
is a good and brave man,

(2) Antonio Lusson y Patlle, Chief of Operations
of the General Staff of the Occidental Army.
AMLASH-1 reports Lusson is an independent and rare
type individual who keeps to hisself and doesn’t
involve himself in political matters, AMLASH-1 hac
beard nothing bad about lusson.


Page 4:
14-00000

-4-

(3) Cadte. Raul Diaz Arguelies, Chief of
Artillery of the Occidental ‘rmy.

(4) Blpidio Baez Bigo, According to ANLASH-1,° :

Baez is a trusted Fidelman.

(5) Luis Manuel Cantillo Toirac, Assigned to
the Cuban Embassy in Madrid and one of the security

people. He was forterly assigned to Brazil, is young

and has for several years been with Pinero and the
Cuban IS.

(6) Enrique Oltuski Osacki. Oltuski is a close

friend of Faustino Perez and his stock vith the regine

rises or falls as does that of Faustino.

(7) Sergio Totlon, Code clerk in the Enbassy in

Paris, Tollon is staying in Paris at the request of
Ambassador Carrillo.

1. Gastro enteritis, water pollution and unsanitary

conditions, AMLASH-1 states there are no real problems,

although the scarcity and lack of a balanced dtet do
cause some problems. The purificetion of water has been

a problem which probably has been the cause of some of the

sickness in the country.

m, AMLASH-1 did not believe that Aragones had invited

im to fly back to Havana with him in order to get bin
ack because of any serious security mattor. AMIASH-1

did state that Aragones was concerned that AMLASH-1 may not

return to Cuba. Since Aragones cleared AMLASH-) for his

trip abroad, he is in a way responsible that AMLASH-1 does

not defect and returns to Cuba. AMLASH-1 feele Aragones
does not want any problems with Fidel in case AMLASH~1

decides to stay out.

n. AMLASH-1 was unable to provide any information on

the political developments tn Cuba in mid-November and

Decenber since he had been out of the country sfnce early

November, AXMLASI-1 was asked to check on the problens

between the opposing factions tn the Cuban leadership and

explained the issues, the background and personalities
involved, .

matters creates re
Cuban offtetats. Basically, the Soviets are not respected.

o. Soviet advise or influence in political and economic
gentment among the alddle and higher level

p. Rank of Cubaa officials under Fidel tn terns of
their influence in making national: policy. Raul is still
the heir apparent to Fidel. Next to Raul is Che Guevara.
After that, no other official, according to AMLASH-1, -has
any great influence din the making of Cuban nattonal policy.
President Dorticos' relationship with Fidel 1s good since
he ip a hard and serious worker, has good sdstnistrati :
ability aid is able to vork within the general outld i
dawn by Fidel, Raul Castro has some political influéace

E nce, but only Fidel personally has any
0. ; ni @ in the rest of Cuba. Even withia the.
military Fidel selects and appoints high army officers,
D ara.i16.still strong in the ecoromie field and
has ‘not spuffered'a decline in his influence and authority
because of hie earliér policy of industrialization.

mself to the economic field and plays
He is serious
ding to AMLASH-1,
who has worked seven days a week without leave since the
revolution. Emilito Aragones holds an important position
as the organizational secretary of the PURS. He is the
official who was always at the affice of the National
Directorate of tho Party and has contact with all the
officials in the regime. He plays an important coordinating
role, Faure Chomou has been accused of organizing former
13th of March Revolutionary Directorate people, but,
according to AMLASH-1, this probably based on the fact that
Chomon always gives jobs in the ministry he heads to DR
people, Because of this Chomon today controls to a large
degree the Ministry of Transportation. Of all the ministries,
the DR's stronghold is in tho Ministry of Transportation.
Other DR people who continue to hold important positions
in the regime are Alberto Mora, Ambassador Carrillo and

Jose Naranjo.

AMLASH-1 and AMWHIP-1 were unable to develop any
specifics, but from their conversations with Ambassador
Carrillo got the impression that Carrillo would prefer and
welcome a transfer from the Embassy in Paris to the

Embassy ip Madrid.

a very small role in the political field.

q.

ry. According to Emtlio Aragoses, Anibal Escalante
ig being considered for a job outside Cuba. Tne job will
probably be in the commercial/economic field, but a
decision had not been made as of November 1964 as to

location,

“e ob

s.. AMLASH-1 again reported that he feels(Oriaado
Blanco,)Consul of the Cuban Bubassy in @ern> is .
approachable since he is unhappy with the Cuban re ime.
AMLASH-1 also feels that (Enrique Rodriguez Loeches
Cuban Ambassador in aba Th approachable if approached
and developed. by the right person. (larina Garcia Gonzates,)o°

- assigned to the ‘commercial section of thé Cubano Embassy
“tin Bada AMLASH-1 feels is also approachable and feels
money can be tised as an tnduderent. Ambassador Carrillo,

| AMLASH-1 feels, sf the proper person developed: him, could

\ probably be compromised with Fidel. . He is a character

_ Mand could easily be entangled according to AMLASH-1 in

wa compromising situation. Ambassador Carrillo is a close
friend of Lucy Echevarria. .

2, AMLASH-1 was 8180 asked information on a long list
of other requirements on Cuba. On many he. was unable to pro-
vide information and cables were sent to Hoadquarters on the
requirements on which he did provide info¥mation.

(Suor appreciated the KGB document forwarded with
Reference and have submitted the following comments and
questions: : .

1. "We have a number of questions about this document
on which we should be grateful for your comments, and aa
background to some of these we think it will be useful for
you tohave an account of QYNNE-ELLTS dealinga with AELADLE:

- ga,” “phey date from June 1961 when he was con-
sidering a visit to the U.S.3.R. He mentioned this to the
Soviet Ambastador, whom he-met at. the Queen's Brthday
Celebration in Helsinki, (he did not realize at first that

.. 4% was the Ambassador to whom he was talking). The Ambassador

“2° guggested that he should get in touch with Ivan Efimovioh
SEROEEV, an identified R.1.S. officer,

8

bd, “Between 5th and 15th July 1961 rnme-ELLIa)
went to the Consular Section of the Soviet Embassy to see
about the viea. Apparently he.did not see SERCFEV but met
AELADLE who showed a good deal of curiosity about him and
asked whether he had ever been to the U.S.3.R. before,
whether he had applied in London for a visa, what he was
doing in Helainki ete, The posaipility of ABLADLE taking
English lessons from{WYNNE-ELLIS)was mentioned and AELADLE
paid he would get in*touch wit SOeNNE-E IS ppout this. He
asked for a short biogrphy on WYNNE-ELLIS

: eo. “He brought the visa application forms and his
biography to AELADLE two days later and | ithough AELADLE was
. apparently very busy he seed WYNNE-ELLIS) for olarification

‘ of various details. AELADLE até not take English lesaons
fron (WYNNE-ELLIS )

a. at ‘t the end of September, or beginning of
Octobexs 1961, WYNNE-ELLIS )received a letter from AELADLE

by the R.I.S (WYNNE-ELLIS telephoned AELADLE to say that

he did not have the new address. AELADLE told him that if
he wanted it, he could have a visa 'tomorrow! to visit
‘Stalingrad (now Volgograd) and.in.the ceurse of cenversats
-gaid ‘sometimes it is better to visit places but not old
friends!, We wondered at the time, and ever more after
AELADLE's defeotion, whether this remark had any special
eignificance. , :

ab
e. “on 16th November AELADLE invited (WYNNE-ELLIS)
to attend a Soviet ooncert, AELADLE told him that he had
been granted a tourist visa but that if he wished to visit
his pen friend he would require a letter of invitation from
him. ARLADLE asked about Hs British trionds in Helsinki and
paid that he would phone @YNNE-ELLID next week to make a
further appointment, He Ad pot do this, ~

f. “A further development whict may be of interest
is that in early January 1952 (WYNNE-ELLIS) received a further
letter from his Kuesian pen frifend giving nim a fairly
preasing invitation to visit him.o6 @(YKKE~ ELLIS) who wags not |
aware of AELADLE'e defecticn, wrote to AELADLE telling him

that he had now receivea the invitation, and inviting hin
to coffee at hie house!

wae dated 25.12.61) so shortly after AELADLE's defection, 4
and after a long gap in the correspondence vetween( WYNN E~ELLIS)
and és 8 pen friend, might indicate that the R.I,S. suspected

he has double-crossed us since he was. turned ) but we would
not exclude this as a possibility - or at ledat would not
exolude the possibility that he might have considered this.

; 4, “our questions on the(WYNNE-ELLIS) document aupplied
by AELADLE are as follows:

a. "What ie the manuscript word at the top of the
first page, and what ia its significance? -

b. “The two typed words, one immediately below
the manuscript word on page 1 and the other to the left, are
not legibie on our copy.

« “Ys there anv significance in the date llth
’ November being in inverted commas, thus "11"¢

ad. “We are puzzled by what at first sight appeared
to be a date, 22.XII.1961, in the heading immediate)yv above
the text on page 1. In fact the Roman numerals 'XIz? are

the cyrillic letter X77, but we do not understand their
meaning, Can .AELADLE. explain this?

e. "What is the name in which the document is
signed, and does AELADLE know the true identity of this person?

f.o"ye are a little surprised at the cyrillio trana-
diteration of WYNNE-ELLIS"s name. We should have expected the
KGB to have a system which vould enable them to get back to
the correct English spelling. Admittedly (WHNNE-ELLIS} 8 name
is an awkward one to deal with.

g. ."We should have expected thet ABLADEZ would hava
~pent a trace request to his Headquarters shortly after the
first meeting with (IYNNE-ELLIS) in July 1961. Yet the reply
was apparently sent~only on llth November, Can AELADLE
comment on this? %

“WG BuBpSest that this dooument might be a forgery, but we
would be grateful for your confirmation that you do not
consider this a possibility,

Guban, believed to bo 9 meuer of a group of wealthy anti-CASTHO Cubana,
menbere of which have talked to Mr. Pawlay recently about their

» 2. Tho unidentified Cuban, who had somewhat of an accent and
opoke indlatinetlv, woe difficult to undorstend. ‘Ho mentioned a
mosting "with somo of our paeple who came up fron Cuba" to disouse

if thero were Amerscana willing to rug the risk of. becoming involved
in Cuban revolutionary sotivitics by furnialing money for sich 8 ©

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with AMBANG-1

1. I met with AMBANG-1 on 27 July 1963 in Miami,
The following is a resume of the business transacted at that

meeting.

a, Request for High Explosives

AMBANG-1 stated that in view of my outline
of strategic targets inside Cuba during our last meeting which
took place in Washington on 2] June 1963, he had decided to
attempt a sabotage operai on against the Havana power plant,
He informed me that he has a man employed in the power plant
in Havana who is capable of launching this operation. In this
connection AMBANG-] asked if we could make available twenty
pounds of high explosives as well as six to eight thermite grenades.
AMBANG-1 asked if it were poscible to have the twenty pounds. -
broken into smaller lots. In our further discussion of this subject,
it became apparent that A-1 would be willing to receive the materiel
either in San Juan or inside Cuba, but that he definitely. preferred
the latter if thia were possible. Like in mést other instances during
our conversation, I advised AMBANG-]! that I would need to discuss
this matter with my superiors but that I could tentatively assure
him of our ability and willingness to furnish the high explosives in
San Juan and possibly inside Cuba. At this point ] asked AMBANG-1
if he could foresee the need for materiel of this type inside Cuba.
Ttold him that I asked this question because if his group were
prepared now or in the near future for meaningful sabotage action
inside Cuba it was conceivable that we could begin the caching of
needed materiel inside Cuba. AMBANG-1 assured me that they _

wee ee



Page 2:
14-0000

were in a position to sabotage the electrical plant in Havana. (I
did not ask, neither did he specify which plant.} He did not promise
immediate action, adding that he wanted to assure himself of the
details of the planned operation and the safety-odds of the man
involved. A-i then indicated that he would certainly be in a
position to accomplish this mission and others in the future and
would be most grateful for any materiel we could put in place.

1 left the matter with him with the understanding that if it were
possible we would proceed with caching the high explosives in
the genera} area of Havana. He assured me of their capability
to service and retrieve the cache.

b. Request for Contact in Guantanamo

AMBANG-1 asked me if it would be possible for ug
to arrange some means for Rogelio Cisneros to visit Guatanamo
and talk to his brother who is an employee of the Naval Base and
another agent of theirs likewise employed there. The reason A-l
gave for the request was that they wished to inform Ramon Cisneros
Diaz of the JURE plans to begin the implementation of their plan
of resistance and overthrow of the Castro Regime. I advised A-l
that whereas I would look into this matter as I could tentatively
tell him that the chances of accomplishing this were remote,

ce, AMBANG-1 Political Plans

AMBANG-] informed me that he was planning at

this time to be in New York on or about 10 August and that following

this trip he intended to go to Sante Domingo and Caracas. In Santo
. Domingo he hoped to set up a smal) base for operations such as a
“ small house on a farm near the shore which could be used for boat
: travel to Cuba. Once he had made such arrangements he intended
. to talk to President Jian Bosch telling him of the plan and asking
; his acquiescence if not support, AMBANG-!] intends to tell Bosch
that he will not embarrass him and will go about his business in a
i secure and professional manner adding that if-he should embarrass
i Bosch, the latter could disclaim him and ‘A-1 would desist from
any further activity there.

: So far as AMBANG-I's trip to Caracas is concerned, that.
- will be principally devoted to orienting the JURE representation

were

Hl

in that city. In addition, AMBANG-] will attempt to see and talk
to Venezuelan Government officials including President Betancourt.

Some time after this trip AMBANG-1 intends to visit
Central America principally Costa Rica and if he can procure a
visa, Mexico. The purpose of all his travel is the raising of funds,
the general tightening of his organization and discussione neccessary
to coordinate their efforts.

d. Isolation of Cuba.

AMBANG-1 made it exceedingly clear that the
lifeline to his assets inside Cuba had been severely restricted
when PAA flights were suspended. Nothing could suit AMBANG-1]
more than to have these flights resumed. AMBANG-1's obviously
great interest in the resumption of these flights was the most eloquent
statement yet of his belief that he has a network, or that he can
revive a network within Cuba. At least at this stage of JURE
operations, AMBANG-1 does not appear to consider the infiltration
of manpower as necessary.

AMBANG-] stated that the use of flights from Spain and
Mexico to Cuba was difficult and costly whereas the Miami-Havana
run had been most useful in maintaining contact within Cuba. It
was AMBANG-I's opinion that the resumption of PAA flights would
be an operational boom to JURE and that whereas he could see
Castro making some political capital out of the flights, he believed
that some appropriate statement such as "there is no political
significance but only a humanitarian and compassionate reason for
the reestablishment of this link, '' would be sufficient to negate any

political advantage by Castro.

e. AMBANG-1 Phasing Out of his Employment

. AMBANG-1 gave me to believe that he is closing shop
and giving up his position with the Corporacion de Renovacion Urbana
y Viviendas where he is employed as an engineer in charge of building
pre-cast concrete houses. AMBANG-1 stated that during the past
week Governor Munoz Marin gave final authority for the erection
of a plant to produce these houses in Puerto Rica. AMBANG-1 is

i

“4.

torn with the thought of leaving this project which he believes
will be most successful, and which would assure his livelihood,
but he knows that he must devote himself to the fight against
Castro, It ie obvious to me that AMBANG-1 will within the next
two months phase out of this employment to devote full time to
the liberation of Cuba,

£. A JURE Radio Link

AMBANG-1 asked me if I would be able to assigt
him in the establishment of a San Juan-Caracas-Miami radio link.
He explained that the JURE has spent a great deal of money on
telephonic communications between these points and were most
anxious to set up a means of radio communication in order to
economize. I guess that AMBANG-1 could tell from my reaction
that I was not too sympathetic to his request for he withdrew it
almost as soon as he had made it. He went on to say that this
was a problem which they could overcome and I presume that he
will seek to establish such radio communications without our

assistance,
g. Aerial Maps of Cuba

AMBANG-! informed me that the JURE membership
had brought cut of Cuba an entire series of maps showing key roads,
bridges, industrial plants, et al, which they had copied by the Aero
Service Corporation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. AMBANG-1
stated that they had received most of these photos from the Aero
Service Corporation but that the 101 were still missing. He gave
me the numbers of those missing and asked if we could procure them,
Ihave since informed. AMBANC-1 that it would perhaps be best it
he could, or his organization, do this instead but that we would
pay the travel of one of his men, should this prove necessary.”
Attached, hereto, is a copy of the missing photos in question,

h, JURE Organization and Strength

AMBANG-] informed me that the membership of the
JURE in San Juan was now at about 500 members and that each
of these individuals makes a weekly contributionto the organization,


Page 5:
14-00000

“T

-S-

In addition there are large JURE organizations in Caracas, Venetucla
and Dallas, Texas. There are according to AMBANG-! a total .
of thirty delegations in Latin America, the U.S.A. and Europe.

Ho cited as an example the delegation in San Francisco which had
recently purchased a typewriter through the collection of green
etamps, He added that Rogclio Cisneros had travelled to San
Francisco some time ago to communicate with that group and to
tighten its organizational activities.

i, AMBANG-1 Asks About ARTIME and the Activities
in Central America

AMBANG-I raised the question of Manuel ARTIME's
activities in Centra! America and particularly in Nicaragua. He
stated that any association with Somoza would not help in creating
the mistigue and political coloration necessary to inspire revolution
and resistance from the non-Communists elements in Cuba. Whereas,
I had expected AMBANG-! to go into a long harangue as to the
positive damage that ARTIME's actions with Sormoza could cause,

he left the matter at about this point. I agreed that the Somozas did not
have a liberal political reputation throughout Latin America, but
added that whatever Cubans cald do from that or any vantage point
against Communism in Cuba would in my estimation be helpful, --
while Iam sure AMBANG-1 did not agree with me, he did not say

80. ln respect to ARTIME and Miro Cardona, whose name entered
into the conversation Jater, AMBANG-1 took a fairly objective view.
He stated that Miro had arrived in San Juan and that he wished him
the best as he figured he had suffered enough. Insofar as ARTIME
was concerned J gathered that AMBANG4-, might feel that the associ-
ation with Somoza would not do ARTIME any good in a post-Castro
Cuba. As AMBANG-1 is convinced that a government after Castro
must be of a progressive liberal stripe, ARTIME was not doing
himself any good by identifying himself with the Sornozas.

j. A List of Cuban Diplomats

As AMBANG-1 had asked for a list of Cuban Diplo-
mats abroad while we were in Paris, I advised him that such a list
had been prepared and we would make it available to him, Inthis —
connection he asked if we could include the addresses of each of the
Cuban installations, Speaking of diplomats, AM BANG-] wanted to


Page 6:
14-00000

know if Ambassador Gustavo Arcos had returned from Prague.

Ll informed him that I did not know. AMBANG-1 was most interested
to learn that Franqui's wife and children had actually come out of
Cuba, and indicated that he would intensify his efforts to maintain
contact with Cuban Diplomat Cabrera Infante in Bruseels as a
means toward the eventual recruitment of Franqui.

k. AMBANG-1 Relation with Jorge Volaky

In conjunction with questions tegarding propaganda
sent to Cuba, and the JURE‘s general plans in this field, I asked
A-! about his relation with Jorge Volaky. A-1 stated that he con-
sidered Volsky to be an extremely able, serious newspaperman.
He added that whereas he saw Volsky frequently on hio trips to
Miami, the latter did not work for him, A-1 stated that Volaky's
work was a full-time job which left him little time to do anything

else.

A-} stated that JURE propaganda was produced by a twelve -

man board.

A-] added that the JURE expected to shortly introduce a
statement on its position into Cuba.

1, AMBANG-I Aske about Two Man Underwater Craft

A-l asked if 1 knew anything about a two man type
craft which travels through the water. I presume A-] was talking
about the "sca-sled." J advised him that I knew little about this |
type craft, but in my opinion ite usefulness for the type activity
he had in mind was limited. AMBANG-I would use this craft for.
the final phaee of an infiltration effort. A-] stated that this craft
was being used at the hotel beaches in San Juan as a type of sporting
activity. I will advise him that he could pursue this matter himeelf
ae all knowledge on this subject is publicly available,

Syeters, ecpecialy ste eamipucity, he wili use tae systeia to

communicate with his chief delegate in Paris and undoubtedly
other persons in Cuba as well as in the other JURE delegations. |

no, AMBANG-1 is Writing an Articie for Cuadernos

At the request of German Arcienegas, the famed

Colombian intellectual, A-l is preparing an article which is to be
published in Cuadernos, The article will dea! with the problems
facing Latin America and how they can be resolved. A-1 will be in
select company as Arcienegas has asked a number of prominent

Latin American intellectuals for their views,

2. General Observations

I beleive AMBANG-1 is planning to return to Cuba.
He indicated that he would give the matter serious thought to
even go in, disguised, as a legal traveller if that road were ;
generally open, i.e., if rather large numbers of travellere were
going in via PAA flights. This line seemed a bit out of character
for A-l, for it seems unrealistic and somewhat remindful of Macaulay's
references to the state of mind that exiles develop, I also detected
what we consider to be a somewhat unrealistic appraisal of the Cuban
situation in A-l's estimate that Castro has coneiderably less than
40% of the Cuban people with hirn, A-l may be Josing more than a
little touch with Cuban reality.

A-! remains convinced that he is on the right track in
working for the eventual overthrow of Castro. He is convinced,
however, that two to three years is all the time left for actually
destroying the Castro regime, believing that there will be a favorable
turn in the Cuban economic situation by late 1965. A-] ie likewise
convinced that Castro cannot add to the improvement of Cuba, to
the contrary that so long as the principal decisions are made by
Castro, the genera) trend will be confusion arising from a failure
to concentrate on specific problems until they are corrected,

AMBANG-I is likewise convinced that the JURE is building
a political group and general outlook which will have an impact on
Cuba for many yeare to come. He is especially concerned with the
need to carefully consider cach position of his grow in order to
create the lasting impression that JURE knows where it is going
and that its leadership is composed of men who know how to "run"
a country without the false starts, confusion and chaos identified

with the Castro regime.

AMBANG-] is likewise greatly concerned with the necessity
of not creating an impression inside Cuba that the JURE will return
to mete out "Justice," It is essential, A-1 states, to convince the
genera! populace that the overthrow of Castro will not result ina
bloodbath, rather that the sole aim is to save the revolution that
has been betrayed, He is anxious that the people inaide Cuba see

TRAINER: Richard M, Fallucci, TPw C/O. , Lob,

fl 1. AMLASH/1 was instructed in S/w techniques by the under-

: signed in a Paris Station safehouse on 17 and 18 August, and was !
: given an S/d review in the final triefing session held in the hotel
i Yoom of Wallace A. Growery (Madrid Station C/O) on 22 August.

: Instruction was given in the use of carbon writing system No. 15136
1 and in the use of liquid developer system No. 56638. The "scorch"

i method of development was also demustrated to A/l as an alternate

system. A total of five hours was devoted to this instruction.

2. A/1, who was recruited a short time prior to coming to
Paris, was introduced to the idea of using S/w by the undersigned
during discussions held in Copenhagen. Although for security
considerations, he was skeptical at first about using such a means
of communication, he was without wadue effort convinced that any ’.
productive relationship depended upon his being able to communicate
with his C/O ona regular basis through. the medium of S/W letters
sent through normal mail channels. It was apparent from his early
questions that he was unfamiliar with the principles of S/@ and clandes-
tine communications in general. after further talks in Paris with
Growery on 26 August, 4/2) was fully prepared to aecept the conceot
of S/a commuications,, and arrangezents were made for this instruction : . 3
to begin the following day. .

3. The first training session on 17 August lasted a little
more than two hours, and was devoted to an explanation of the S/W i
system of commnication, including careful instruction in the :
preparation of a letter containing S/¥. A/1 also prepared an S/W
letter of his own under the Supervision of the undersigned. He
seemed to grasp readily the principles of the preparation of an S/w

message and experienced only a little difficulty at first in remember-
ing all the steps in sequence necessary for the preparation of an S/W
Message. He was generally attentive to the instruction given. How-
ever, in keeping with his temperment, he was a little impatient

during the preparation of the S/w message itself upon the cover

letter. At the end of this session, he demonstrated that he remembered
the basic steps in a satisfactory mamner, particularly considering

that it wae his first day in S/W instruction. :

4. The second period of instruction took place in the same
safehouse, lasting about two hours. This session was devoted toa
review of the S/W procedures and the preparation by A/l of another
practice S/W letter. Following this, Af. was instructed in the
development of S/W messages, using the liquid developer No. 56538
The scorch system of develonzent was also demonstrated. A/1 was
impressed by the simplicity of the liquid developer and the immediate
reaction which it produced. The undersigned developed one message;
then 4/1 was allowed to prepare the developer from its dry pill form
and to develop a second practice s/w message for himself. Following
the pericd devoted to S/W development, a general review of S/W
communications was held, the basic points apparently being well-fixed
in A/1's mind.

5. During the final formal meeting with A/1 un 22 August

with Growery and the undersigned participating, the latter gave A/1

@ general review of all the S/s procedures which were to be used

it his contact with KUBARK. He also was provided with the following
tems: :

A. Two sheets of S/W carbon paper f No. 338)

B. Forty-seven pills of developer ( No. 56638

C. One tablet of writing paper provided by TSD and
known to be compatible with the carbon sheets.

D. 3 No. 2 pencils of French manufacture.

E. One ball-psint pen with water-resistant ink.

F. Two accomodation addresses: one in Madrid for
regular contact; one in New York City for rapid
emergency contact (see attached S/w data sheet).

G. Appropriate indicators (see S/W data sheet)

It is noted that 4/1 did not have a secure accomodation address in
PBRUMEN to give us at this time. He was told, however, that it was
imperative that he provide one for us by S/W letter within two weeks
of hie return to PBRUMEN. This he stated he would do.

6. During the last S/w review, A/1 was shown a photograph
of one of his practice messages which he had prepared. He was quite
interested in seeing this, which served to illustrate a number of the
training points which had been covered during previous instruction.

Generally, A/1 was an interested pupil and it is believed that he
will be able to carry out the instructions in a proper manner. He
is quite security conscious, a factor which it is believed, will add
to his attempts to seek perfection in his S/¥ correspondence and

in the secure storage of his S/W materials when not in use. It is
also knom that A/l practiced his S/ techniques in his hotel room
after leaving the 22 August meeting. This is known because he had
an additional question to ask us at a brief meeting on 23 August.

7. It should also be noted that the TSD technician who
developed A/1's practice letters recommends that for best results,
all letters from A/1 be subjected to ammonia fuming before immersion

in the developer.

, The April 9, 1963, issue of the "Miami News"
carried an article entitled, "Exiles Say Miro.To Quit",
This article stated that informed exile sources claim
that Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA would rezizn his post as head
of the Cuban Revolutionary Council. Tne article said
exile sources gave two possibllities for his resignation.
One faction believed that MIRO's recent trip to Washington
from which he returned Sunday (April.7) was to pin down the
United States Government to a Statement of positive policy
regarding Cuba. Another school of thought was that the
Council head was retiring from hia poet in protest of:
Governnent curbing of hit-and-run raids on the Comaunist
island of Cuba.

The article went on to state that Dr. MIRO's
leadership in the Council, aimed at uniting all Cuban
exiles, nas been burdened by protlems since his appointment

in March 1961,

On April 10, 1963, MM T-1, a former Cuban
business executive, who is employed ‘hy the Cuban Revolutionary
Council and who is a close bersonal friend of Dr. MIRO CARDONA,
who has furnizhed some reliable information in the past,
advised that an all-night sesaion of the Council was held
beginning April 9, and ending at about 6:00 A.M., on
April 10, during which time MIRO CARDONA presented his
resignation but the Council refused to accept his resignation
and MIRO CARDONA was persuaded to remain as President of the

Council.

MM T-1 said that MIRO's resignation consisted of
a 25-page statement which was in effect an indictment against
the administration of President JOi F, KENNEDY of the United
States. In rejecting his resignation, the Council backed up

"The Cuban Revolutionary Council, having studied
the report of its President, Dr. Jose Miro Cardona, concerning
Present relations with the United States Government, agrees:

"1. Not to accept the resignation of Dr. Jose Miro Cardona,
and declare its full Support for the basic plans contained
in his resignation,

"2. To affirm that there is a serious erisis, brought about
by the present policy of the government of this country,

"3. To express the Council's hope of overcoming the present
crisis and calling upon all of America, including the United
States, for moral and material Support in their fight to
regain their sovereignty and independence, and the strict
fulfilment of American treaties and agreements, as well

as the joint resolution of the U.S. Congress, calling for
effective action against Soviet intervention in America,

"4, To affirm that the Council has always insisted, and
still insists, upon the necesaity of Cuban participation

in the process of liberating Cuba. The only procedure
which the Council would accept would be coordination of
forcea, on a plane of complete respect for national dignity,
Cuba will never renounce her legitimate right to be in the
first line of combat,

MK T-1 explained that when Dr, MIRO CARDONA returned
to Miami from a trip to Washington, D. C., on Sunday, where he
contacted high government officials, he came away with the

feeling that:

1) The United States nas no plan to free Cuba
of Communism.

2) If the United States ever does formulate any
plans, 1t will do so without consideration
for the Cuban exiles in the United States.

3) The United States policy 1s now one of
peaceful co-existence with Communist Cuba.

MM T-1 said that in his opinion, the Cuban exiles
are frustrated, confused, losing faith in the United States
and there is a growing feeling of abandonment of them by the

United States.

The April 10, 1963, issue of the "Miami Herald"
earried a headline article entitled, “Miro Resigns as Exile
Chief; Raps U. S. Policy". This article stated that MIRO
CARDONA resigned because the United States refused to allocate
fifty million dollars to train a Cuban invasion force, according

to government sources. The article said that exile leaders.
close to HIRO said he resigned not only because of disagree-
ment witn United States policy, “but because he feels
Waeningcon dves not have any concrete plans to deal with

the dictator”,

The April 11, 1963, 1asue of the "Miami Herald"
carsied an article entitled, "Cuban Extle Council Vows to
Continue the Freedom Fight", In this article it was
Btated that the Cuban Revolutionary Council had vowed to
continue ite fight against Castro-Communism whether the
United 3tates likes it or not. The article said that Dr.
MIRD CAZLONA denied reports from U. S. Government sources
that he offered his resignation to the Council because the
United Zcates refused to allocate fifty million dollars to
train a Cuban invasion force. The article stated thet an
informed gource said that MIRO decided to quit "because
of the change in the U. S. - Cuban poltoy™.

Tne April 16, 1963, issue of the "Miami Herald”
carried an article entitled "JFK Accepts Demand, Fidel Says",
This article by the UPI bearing a Havana dateline reported
that PIcZL CASTRO told Cubans on Thursday (April 11) that the
KENUEDY Administration has accepted one of his five demands
for an er4 to tension in the Caribbean. ‘This article stated
that in a one hour and forty minute speech, CASTRO said that
Washington in forbidding exiles to carry on further armed
attacxa on Cuba, has fulfilled one-off "five points for peace"
advanceicy him and endorsed by the Soviet Union. The article
then went on to state that FIDZL announced that there are
Still fcir conditions to be fulfilled and that acceptance of
them 18 tne only sensible thing the KENNEDY Administration
can do, One of the five conditions, according to the article,
ia U. 3. evacuation of the big Naval base at Guantanamc,

Gn the morning of April 15, 1963, Miami radio news

broadcasts announced MIRO CARDONA would again offer his
resignation to the Council on that same day.

On April 15, 1963, MM T-1 advised that he was
positive that MIRO CARDONA did not intend to again tender
his resignation on Monday, April 15, 1962, but was
contemplating taking that action on the following Thursday,
April 18, 1963. MM T-1 said that the Council was meeting “~....
on Thureday to take a ‘definite attitude ortough line of ee
action and that it waa entirely probable that all of the
members of the Council might resich in protest to the present
policy of the United Ztates with regard to the Cuban situation.
He said that the prezent feeling of the Council towards the
United States is tasically “to hell with it".

MM T-1 expreased the personal feeling that U. 3S,
policy towards Cuba 18 presentlyin a vacuum and consequently
everything 18 at a standstill. Ine Cuban exiles in the
Miami area feel that the U. S. is abandoning their cause
and has now adopted a course of peaceful cc-existence with

Communist Cuba.

On April 16, 1963, MM T-2, a Cuban exile who has .
furnished some reliable information in the past and who is we
associated with fellow Cubans who belong to several different
organizations, ddvieed that reaction among the Cuban exiles
is “very bad against the United States". He explained that the
Cuban exiles allege that President KENNEDY nas made promises
to help them in their fight against CASTRO but i8 now opposing
them and consequently they feel that the U. 8. 18 now committed
to a policy of peaceful co-existence with Communist Cuba. :

“ The Cuban exiles are fearful as to the future, confused as to
why the U. S. has changed ite policy and the exiles feel that
they have been abandoned in their fight.

FROM

SUBJECT: THE LEE HARVEY OSWALD CASE #351164

1. According to a newspaper column of "Allen and Scott" in the
Chicago American of 6 December 1963, on the OSWALD Case, Abram CHAYES,
Legal Officer of the State Department, was one of two persons im-
mediately responsible for OSWALD's being permitted to return to the
United States from the Soviet Union in June 1962. The other individual
named was Llewellyn THOMPSON, the then Ambassador to Russia. Another .
said to have been involved in the handling of OSWALD's case was Samuel
WISE, Counsel of the American Embassy in Moscow.

2. Abram CHAYES, #352234, who as of 16 February 1961 was described
as "the new Counsel in State", was granted Security approval for Liaison
contact with J. Foster COLLINS (in the office of the Chief of the Covert
Action Staff) on 6 March 1961. The request for CHAYES' clearance was a
"Blanket" request to permit discussion with him of NSC 5412/2 matters on
a need-to-know basis. ,

3. In September 1961 there was a White ,House namecheck request on
CHAYES' wife Antonia (Toni) Leigh CHAYES, nee: HANDLER.

4, In March 1962, CHAYES was granted a renewal of his liaison
contact clearance with C/CA on a continuing basis. This time his contact
was Archibald ROOSEVELT, Jre

5. On 10 February 1962, HUMAN EVENTS reported as follows with
reference to CHAYES: .

“SOFT ON COMMUNISM: Representative Francis E. Walter (R.-Pa.),
Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, has
scored the new State Department regulations on passports, claim-
ing they would allow Reds denied passports to "rifle freely the
confidential files of the FBI, the CIA and other investigative
agencies." The man behind the new regulations, which Walter
claims violate the Internal Security Act of 1950, is reportedly
State's chief legal officer, Abram Chayes. Chayes, a Kennedy
appointee, is an ex-Harvard professor who was Chester Bowles’
top legal adviser when Bowles was Governor of Connecticut.
Walter has introduced legislation to remedy the new passport

regulations."

6. Samuel WISE, "Counsel in the American Embassy in Moscow" who
is referred to above, may well be Samuel Griffin WISE Jr., #74574
SD & SSD, who apparently was once a contract employee on
[The State Department reviewed WISE's file on 2 June 1954; and as of
September 1962 a Samuel G. WISH was Second Secretary of the American
Embassy in Moscow. At that time WISE advised in a cable to the State
Department that it appeared that Bruce Frederick DAVIS, #352267, who
defected from the United States Army in Germany on 18 August 1960, had
not expatriated himself. DAVIS' case is very similar to that of
OSWALD; and he, like OSWALD, lived in the Soviet Union for two years
after his defection and prior to making application for return to the
United States.7

7. WISE was an applicant for CIA employment in early 1953 and
was security approved subject to polygraph on 11 August 1953. He did
not enter on duty and in September 1953 the office which had been
interested in him was "no longer interested". On 13 November 1953,
WIS! was granted a CSA to permit his use as a contract employee on
ff in New York City. His CSA was cancelled on 24 March 1958.

8. WISE was named as a friend of William Orville MUNSELL, #61693-DL,
during an investigation of the latter for possible CIA employment in 1952.
WISE, according to MUNSELL's landlady and social acquaintance in Washington,
D.C. during the period of about a year which ended in April 1952, was the
only person she knew by name with whom MUNSELL was friendly. According
to the informant, WISE was a student at Columbia University whose address
was 423 Furnald Hall. MUNSELL was Security disapproved for CIA employment
in June 1952 because of his close association on a professional and social
basis, while attending Denver University from 1946 to 1951, with persons
of questionable loyality. In November 1954, MUNSELL was of interest to
project S#RRWHwith reference to assignment to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia;
however, the interested office withdrew their request on him, after
Security advised of the derogatory information regarding him.

9. WISE from 1951 to 1954 attended Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale,
New York, which was attacked by a Citizen's Group, which alleged Communist
influence in the school system. He had several questionable associates in
addition to MUNSELL.

KENT EXTRACT


Page 2:
ke.

Mr. William M. Kent joined the Agency in December
1951. He had previously received a degree in diplomatic
and public relations from the Latin American Institute,
New York City and had served time in the U.S. Army from
1946 to 1948. He graduated from the Latin American
Institute with. the highest honors and 4 awards.

Mr. Kent was initially assigned to the Office of
Special Operations as a clerk typist and,, after. six ns
months, in’June 1952, was assigned fof pantiaa] as an
intelligence officer "under non-official cover. In July o ; fete
1956 he returned to Headquarters where he worked as an :
area operations officer-in the Western Hemisphere Divi-

sion. After a-successful stint in. the Cubayg petion he
was assigned as an operations officer, tp, iG Gas) After
an excellently productive tour in (Car <8 Mr. Kent was _.

selected to join JMWAVE in Miami. Cares he really shone
as attested to in the following quote from his fitness
report: "He has been placed in most difficult positions,
particularly in the handling of incompatible people and
groups which he has managed without alienating either he
side and on various occasions accomplishing the impossible on
by satisfying everyone concerned."' After his tour in Miami,
. he headed several sections in Headquarters in the Western
© . Hemisphere Division, In 1967 he was transferred to New
Orleans and then to the Washington Base. .In both places
he worked under fton- official cover}? From 1970 until his
_ retirement he served in several Capacities ranging from
the planning and guiding of Covert Action programs to
- occupying managerial positions. During these eight years.
he received seven strong and three outstanding overall
ratings. Of special note are the various.commendation- ——
and laudatory reports: concerning Mr. Kent's performance during
the "Chilean crisis". Because of his excellent performance -
during the Chilean crisis he again was asked to help the
Latin American Division during several investigations. He
performed admirably as reflected in a commendation.. written
: by the Deputy Chief of LA Division on 5 December 1975:
- "When confronted with a need to produce a paper on Chile in
. a short timeframe, I instinctively turned to him. It was not
a only because he had expertise on Chile, but to service in
ae the Chile Branch, but because he is highly skilled in written
presentation, — He organizes his material well and presents
‘it in a lucid, highly readable manner. On the first occasion,
he helped us prepare a paper that was eventually used by the
Director in his presentation before the Senate Select Com-
mittee ‘on -14-15* July. On the second occasion his contribution

OO was used by the DDO in his appearance before the Senate.
se Select Committee on 28 October. Both of these papers
were excellent and have withstood critical scrutiny."

Mr. Kent has now left the Agency after 26 years of
distinguished service as an operations officer and as a
manager both in the field and at Headquarters. On the
occasion of his.retirement, it is appropriate that Mr.

Kent's career achievements be suitably recognized. It
‘.is recommended that he be awarded the Career Intelligence.
Medal in recognition of his long and distinguished service.

c. Memorandum for the record on DDP briefings;
d. Record of conversation with the President.

The visit is considered to have been a success and Chiang Ching-kuo
returned with an understanding that any abrupt move by his govern-
ment to recover the mainland with military force would not be
supported by this country. Chiang Kai-shek has accepted the position

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

‘SUBJECT: 303 Committee Meeting - 18 June 1964

1. Item I: Autonomous erations.

This was raised in view of Manuel Ray's request for
- $25, 000 and indications that he is attempting to make a new expedition to
Cuba in a chartered ship. Various courses of possible action with Ray
were discussed, ranging from.cutting him off altogether to giving him
the money. It developed that Ray is acting inconsistently with the agreement
with him which was that he would operate outside the United States. Therefore
it was decided that we would tell him that he must abide by the agreement,
that he must find.a base of operations outside the United.States and if he does
we will endeavor to secure the release of his ship which is now in Puerto Rico,
and that we will give him financial support.
we 2. With respect to antime 2 was pointed out that Artime's
operations are very costly. CIA has pur( 4. 6 smillion nto this operation
this year - the future bill will be large, bUt not as great. FitzGerald
reported that Artime planned one hit and run.operation a month, but he noted
he would be lucky if he could pull off one every 3 months. Bundy seemed to
feel Artime was more of a threat than an operator and should be maintained
for that purpose and operations discouraged. FitzGerald pointed out this is
not practical. It was agreed to proceed with Artime recognizing that U.S.
or CIA support of him would probably be "blown''. Furthermore it was.
suggested that he be cautioned to be careful and not follow unduly reckless
courses of action.

3. There was a long discussion on the implications of the CIA
June 10th memorandum reporting plans of Cuban exiles to assassinate leading
Cuban, government leaders. This report was taken most seriously by the group.
It was felt that the purpose of advising us through CIA of these plans was to
put us on notice and therefore we should not fail to take appropriate precautionary
actions to see that no assassination attempt of which we had knowledge was
carried out. It was decided that ‘appropriate authorities, i.e. Department of
Justice and the FBI, .. should be notified and urged to take appropriate action
against the individuals. involved. .

I took the position that we are overly exercised, that I was
inclined to write the whole thing off as Miami cocktail party talk rather than
definite plans. Had I seen the Memo before it was distributed, I would have
investigated the sources and the credibility of the whole thing before taking
action. However the group were more concerned than I and therefore planning to
discuss the subject with the Attorney General and possibly Mr. Hoover.



Page 2:
13-00000- -

I pointed out that copies of the Memorandum had been sent
to the Attorney General and the Department of Justice but there had been
no conversation on the subject.

.ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms
steps we should take to establish the
credibility of the report; also communicate
with the FBI through Mr. Papich. Also l
should call the Attorney.General personally.

4. Prior to the meeting Mr. Vance asked my opinion of using
the 22 million psyops leaflets which inadvertently had been printed on

U.S. manufactured white sulphite paper, all as reported in MACV
cable MAC SOG 5050 dated 18 June 1964 (IN 09143). I told Vance that I felt

we should go ahead. It was too bad it had been done this way, but it is one of
those things that a person not thoroughly acquainted with this type of operation

might overlook. He was in agreement and presumably will instruct the release
of the leaflets. ‘ :

. With respect to 4,, instructions were to be given that the primary
purpose of the flights was to survey border activity and the 30 mile shot

is provided to give range and operational flexibility. I felt in reviewing
McMillan's proposal that if the SAC planes were to go as far north as the
2ist parallel, then they should go all the way to the China border and the
proposed CIA operation out of Takhli should be abandoned. This raised the
question of whether civilian or military planes and pilots should be over
North Vietnam to the extent which could not be explained as being "off |
course" i
limited as outlined above or should cover the entire country.

Otherwise the operation was approved.

Alexis Johnson and Mr. Bundy raised: questions of the conse quences
of finding an arms cache or knocking over an infiltration at the time of the
OAS debate on the Venezuelan problem. Arguments were persuasive that _
we should go slowly during this period. I read from the February 25th
Cuban checklist of the deterioration of the spirit of the people of Cuba,. the
feeling that we were about to recognize the Castro government.and the apathy
toward further resistance as evidence of the price we are paying for
slow-downs and deferments of action against Cuba. I said that I thought our
Cuban program was in:‘complete disarray. We had no policy or covert

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Clandestine and Covert Activities Against Cuba

The objective of the U. Ss. Government is to overthrow.
the Castro/Communist regime in Cuba, In accomplishing its
objective, the U. S. is not willing to risk nuclear war or, at
this time, | substantial deterioration in its relations with its
Allies, or significant escalation in tensions between this .
country and the Soviets. Thus, any covert U. S, program
should be set at a level that is not likely to incur’ such risks,
Such a program would appear to be a low-risk, clandestine
program of harassment and sabotage directed against Cuba,
In addition, a program of higher risks seems justified when
it is directed against Cuban subversion of Latin America.

Actions Against Cuba |

1, Sabotage. A low level campaign of sabotage and
harassment against Cuba might include such targets as the
Canete Saw Mill, smaller POL storage plants (such as the
one at Pilon), the Nazabal warehouse and pier, and ships
(such as barges or Cuban patrol boats), Where possible,
it would. seem desirable to make the raids appear to have
come from within Cuba, Cuban ships outside Cuba can be sabotaged
by discreet means (such as placing sand in gears or sugar in fuel).

2. Harassment of Free World Shipping to Cuba.

a) Initiate a more comprehensive program of
overt and covert pressure against Free World firms trading

7 ‘with Cuba. In this connection, develop.a comprehensive list

of firms doing business with Cuba, check them against known
DOD off-shore and foreign purchase suppliers so that
appropriate retaliation can be applied against those suppliers,

b) Place unactivated incendiary and explosive
devices in cargoes and on ships bound for.Cuba and subse- .
quently "tip  off'' port or shipping offigials so that they will
search and discover the devices with the attendant publicity.

cOPYNo, fof & —scopics



Page 12:
3. Covert Economic Activities.

a) Intensify covert activities directed against
critical commodities destined for Cuba with resort, if
necessary, to.carefully considered and controlled preclu-
sive ‘buying. ; oo

b) Make it known discreetly through the press
that we maintain careful records of the companies dealing
with Cuba, suggesting without saying so that these records
constitute a potential "blacklist. "

c) Form a group of responsible and qualified
Cuban exile businessmen to maintain pressure on firms
trading with Cuba by indicating that such firms will have
no future in a post-Castro Cuba.

4. To the extent possible, encourage dissidence
among different factions in Cuba - Peking, Moscow,
Nationalist -~ by spreading rumors, internal and
external sabotage designed to accomplish this purpose
(such as actions against homes of leaders, etc).

Actions Against Cuban Subversion in Latin America

1. Develop a list of vulnerable Cuban agents in Latin
America against whom a concentrated program of bribery,

blackmail and coercion canbe instituted.

2. Carefully select key Latin American members of

| the Havana-Peking school and institute a program of kidnapping,

and personal and physical harassment, while attempting to
‘attribute these acts to rivals who support Moscow, Institute
the reversé process as a retaliatory program against Moscow

. supporters,

Any of the foregoing activities would be conducted against
a background of U. S, propaganda: (black, white and gray) and
political activity designed to increase internal dissension within
Cuba, to support economic isolation of Cuba, to avoid splitting °
with our allies over the Cuban issue and.to reduce, and perhaps
eliminate, Castro subversion of Latin America, . In addition,
surveillance activities should be significantly stepped up.

1. AMLILAC/33 obtained the following information from
IDEN A and IDEN B, former members of the AMWORLD Group. The
date of the information is mid-july 1964.

,

a. IDEN A was an instructor in a commando section
headed by IDEN C, in a camp located near IDEN D. He was
given the job of instruction in the AR-15 and AR-10 rifles.
Since no manuals were available he had to use the book,
Small Arms of the World. The men in IDEN C's command are
unhappy because they do not trust the planning judgement of
IDEN C. The second in command, IDEN E, is so hated by the
men that when IDEN C leaves the camp he has to take IDEN E
with him.

b. The Intelligence, Chief of AMWORLD is IDEN F. He
-maintains that the Sat a for men in the INTEL section

is personal loyalty to AMBIDBY/1. At one time a PBPRIMER,
who works with AMBIDDY/1, prgsented IDEN F with a list of

men for duty in the Intel section. IDEN F accepted the

list and the men but after the PBPRIMER left he transferred
the men to other sections. Recently IDEN F arrested a man

in the Group and charged him as a spy for AMBANG/1. The

man was physically beaten and jailed. Later IDEN F admitted
he made a mistake, released the man, gave him several hundred
dollars and told him to forget the incident.

“- '@, . The Navy section is composed of a Chief, IDEN G,
Chief of Operations, IDEN H, and Assistant Chief of Opera-
tions, IDEN I. The morale of the ship's crews is low and
many of them state that they will jump ship at the first
‘port of call. A large powered barge is anchored at the Navy
Base and contains all the arms, and ammunition. There is a
- Staging base in IDEN J. A new base of ships is being set up
in IDEN K along with an airstrip. Teams for operations will
‘be flown to this base from IDEN J, go by ship on the opera-
tion, return to this base, and then fly back to IDEN J.

d. For operational briefings AMWORLD uses the same
photos KUBARK uses (The men who have worked for KUBARK and
AMWORLD are aware of this.). ‘

e. AMBIDDY/1 spends most of his time flying around
Central America in a light plane. He has hired IDEN L, a
free lance PBRUMEN photographer , to,film the camps and
activities and to publicize AMWORLD.

£. IDEN M stated that AMBIDDY/1 acknowledged that he
planned one operation per month for the next 3 months and
then make an all out push with the guerrilla teams. IDEN M
commented that if things did not improve AMWORLD would not
‘be in existence 3 months from now. .

g. AMWORLD has 3 large houses in the capital of IDEN J
for recreation, Small groups are escorted to these houses
from the camps. There is no limit to expenses for drinking
and eating. °

h. The chief engineer ffr the group is IDEN N.- He is
in charge of building the airstrips.

Operational Developments:

. lL. Seven SW messages were received from AMFAUNA=26 during the
period, and two were sent to her. Two SW messages written by AMFAUNA-2'
“no. 34 and no. 36, have not been received and it is. not known what has
happened to them, It. has been observed that mail to and from Cienfuego:
is very slow and uncertain; SW message no. 10 sent to AMFAUNA-26 on 6
November did not reach her until 22 December.

2. +A continuing effort was made during the period to activate

~ AMFAUNA-26's OWVL and medium speed radio systems. OWVL transmissions

, were begun on 16 October with message no, 1 warning AMFAUNA-26 of the
arrest of AMFAUNA-14 the week before {see AMFAUNA-1 Progress Report for
October, November and December 1963) and the fact that AMCUTLER-2 was
under surveillance, AMFAUNA-26 was unable to receive this message. In,
her SW-message no. 35 of 25 October, she reported that her radio set is
calibrated in meters instead of kilocycles and she had been unable to
find the correct.frequency. JMWAVE then sent AMFAUNA~26 instructions
for" converting kilocycles to meters, and began transmitting dummy
messages, giving AMFAUNA-26 a simple code for reporting by commercial
telegram whether she was receiving them, and whether and with what books
she was able to decipher.

3. Two sets of deciphering materials had been sent to AMFAUNA-26,
One package was buried by AMGLEN-9 in: Pinar del Rio Province (see WAVE-.
5887 of 16 October 1963), and AMFAUNA-26 was informed of its location
in OWVL message no. 1 of 16 October and SW message no. 10 of 6 November.

'October, .It now appears that AMFAUNA-26 never regel either of these
‘sets of groups.” As of, 22 November when AMFAUNA-26's sister -Olga arrived
in Mextco (see paragraph 5), AMFAUNA-26 already had in'her possessfon ¢ +
the letter containing the groups written in SW, but either had trida and
failed to develop it, or had hesitated to try to do so, not knowing in
‘what strength to use the reagent and erroneously thinking that this was

a critical factor. As mentioned previously, AMFAUNA-26 did not receive
SW message no, 10 until 22 December; on the. following day she sent an
open telegram to the son of AMFAUNA-32 in Miami, confirming her willing-
ness to travel to Pinar del Rio and recover the material. It is not
known whether she actually did so,

4, It had been planned, | once AMFAUNA-26 wa; ving OWVL and
her ability to recover caches confirmed, to have¢AMWEE-l\cache AMFAUNA~1 |r
radio. and to inform AMFAUNA-26 of its location by OWL. ~ Events did not
permit: this.

5, AMFLORA-1 sent. a - telegran to his ‘JMWAVE area accommodation
address on 16 November 1963, reporting that his wife,: the sister of .
AMFAUNA~26, was due to arrive in Mexico City on 20 November, Mexico
‘City Station was so informed on 18 November (see WAVE-7762), but by the
time confirmation arrived (MEXI-7031'of 23 November) the lady had
already departed for Caracas. The oral messages which she brought from
AMFAUNA~26 therefore did not reach JMWAVE until 20 December when HVCA-
10780 was recéived, - This dispatch transmitted a typewritten note from
AMFLORA~1's wife containing the following information:

a. AMFAUNA-26 had run out of developer pills. (In retrospec#
this does not seem to be true, because AMFAUNA~26 was evidently able to

..develop SW message no, 10 which she received on 22 December (see paragragl:

3).- What AMFAUNA-26 had probably been trying to convey was that she
was running very short of pills. AMFAUNA-1-does not remember how many
he gave her, but the most probable number appears to be twelve.)

: b. AMFAUNA-26 had been unable to develop the SW message
containing her cipher groups, because she had not been told how to mix
her reagent.

c.° AMCUTLER-2 was very worried by the fact that AMFAUNA-14
had been telephoning her frequently, and was afraid that ; AMFAUNA-14 was
betraying her to the DSE.

ad. AMFAUNA-26 was uneasy about being left in Cuba without a
responsible leader to report to,

e. AMFAUNA-26's cover was wearing very thin, due to indis-
 eretions »by- AMFAUNA-31,

6. In her SW message no. 29, which was received at JMWAVE on 21
October, AMFAUNA-26 reported that AMFAUNA-38 had been arrested on 7
September and taken to Santa Clara. At 0200 hours on the following
morning, fourteen policemen came to AMFAUNA-26's house and searched it
on the pretext of looking for a burglar. However, the only part of the
house which they searched was the part. inhabited By cf AMFAUNA-26.

ye

fe 7. %In her SW message no. 30, AMFAUNA-26 ppoxted “the full names.
éf ‘two individuals who had approached her sub: 1gents AMFAUNA-29 and

FAUNA-31, claiming t e doing underground werk against CASTRO. These
persons are one Amable #SANCHEZ Borroto and fne Raul #¥SIMON Delgado.
While neither JMWAVE nor Headquarters (DIR-78835 of 30 October 1963)
had any traces on these persons, JMWAVE has a carded reference to a
sensitive source document which carries the full name of Amable SANCHEZ
Borroto and the implication that he enjoys the confidence of the Cuban
Government. Unfortunately, an error was mad typing the card, and
the document is unrecoverable. In SW messag 0: AMF AUNA-26 was
_told to. be careful: with the person. RS

9. In outgoing SW message no, 9 of 30 September, AMFAUNA~26 had

She reported. in SW message no. 37 of 3 November that all reports on
this individual were derogatory except for one given by AMLAME-5, This
report reached AMFAUNAS 26 via AMFAUNA-31 who got it from a man identified

' 11, The reason for AMFAUNA-26's arrest ‘remains obscure, or rather

: there are so many acceptable explanations that the problem is to select

j the right one, She could have been implicated by AMFAUSA-38, as would |

: seem to be suggested by the fact that her house was searched immediately

following AMFAUNA-38's arrest; if so, however, it is hard to explain

| why AMFAUNA-26 herself was not arrested until three and one-half months
later. She could -thave been denounced by AMCUTLER-2 who was herself
arrested two or three days before AMFAUNA-26's arrest; this seems unlikel
in view of the fact that AMCUTLER-2 and AMFAUNA-26 are friends, that when
AMCUTLER-2 reaches the point where she is ready to implicate other
members of the AMFAUNA net she could be expected to begin with people
who are not her friends, and that at least one such person (AMFAUNA-25) |
was known to be at liberty as recently as 4 January 1964, as were two of
the cutouts between AMFAUNA-26 and AMCUTLER~2 (AMFAUNA-32 and AMFAUNA-33 );
AMCUTLER-2 is’ believed to have been under surveillance by the DSE, at !
least sporadically, between 12 and 24 October (see AMFAENA-1 Progress i
Report for October, November, and December 1963), and AMFAUNA-26 could jl

1

have been observed and identified when she visited AMCUFLER~2 during

this period and. marked for subsequent arrest and interrogation in
connection with AMCUTLER-2's activities. AMFAUNA-26 could have made an
attempt between 22 and 29 December to recover the cached cipher groups

, (see paragraph 3), and either been detected in the act or arrested while .
4 trying to contact AMCUTLER-2 on the same trip; in this case, however, '
; it would seem that the DSE would not have transported her all the way
back to Santa Clara but would have kept her in Havana for concurrent
interrogation with AMCUTLER-2, The open telegram sent to the son of
AMFAUNA-32 on 23 December was rather indiscreet and could have caused
difficulties for the sender, but some of these difficulties ought in this
case to have brushed off on AMFAUNA-32 herself, and as of 3 January 1964

‘ she-was still at liberty. ° . .

The’ only known factor common to both AMLAME-5 and AMFAUNA-26 is the
Ramon *PEREZ mentioned in paragraph 9.  AMLAME-5 evidently was extra- |
ordinarily indiscreet when he talked with this mam. AMIFAUNA-31 has also :
spoken with him, and according to the oral message brought out by
AMFAUNA-26's sister (see paragraph 5-e) AMFAUNA-31 has been habitually
‘indiscreet.. Ramon PEREZ was thus in a position to denounce both AMLAME-5,
_and AMFAUNA-26. If so, AMFAUNA-31 also ought to have been implicated,
and it is perhaps significatn in this connection that, of all of

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT: Requirements Briefing to FBI Informant Going to Cuba

1, In accordance with arrangements previously made, with the FBI by
SAS/CI/Liaison, the undersigned went to New York on{8 Julysto brief an
FBI informant who is going to Cuba for two weeks, I had a short session
at the FBI office in NYC with Dale Schwant, the case officer, and we then
met with the informant for about two hours in a room at the Prince George
Hotel, The informant had been told that I would be at the meeting and that
I represented the Agency, but I was not introduced to him by name,

2, The EBI informant Mita a Thomas rs Vieests - is an American-
born Puerto EEantporn 1 in N He has been under FBI control for
nearly 3 years penetrating the fe 50, He hae organizations in NYC: the

Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC); the Casa Cuba, and the Jose Marti
Club., Though the first two years Subject was only a marginal asset, in the
last six months he has become a the Guba penetrati or the FBI into the

above 3 organizations as well as the (Cuban UN delegitio 4 having apparently
won the complete confidence of the pro-Castro leaders and Cuban officials

in NYC. Recently he was asked to join the CPUSA, Subject works aga
shipping clerk in a coffee plant in Brookly He has the appearance and other
attributes, according to Dale Schwant, for the role of pro-Castro revolutionary,
The Cubans have expressed an interest in his moving to Cuba to work, He is
willing to go but his wife is against it, but idea is still alive,

armed with a letter of introduction from the(National Director of the FPCC,
Vitent Theodore Lee] On 6 July the 3 pro-Castro organizations named
above held a party for Subject and raised $100. 00 for his trip,

Informant's Contacts in Cuba

4, Subject will contact several friends in Cuba who are milicianos, one
of them in Santiago, Oriente Province, They were fellow activists in pro-
Castro organizations in NYC who have returned to Cuba, He also has been
given (by his Cuban friends) the address of a family whose son is the chauf-
feur of Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, Arrangements have also been made for
Subject to talk to the American Communist in Habana, Robert Williams,
Subject, who will be accompanied by his wife on this trip, has been instructed
by his Cuban superiors to take a camera with him to take pictures of Cuba for
showing at organizational meetings in NYC, Something similar had been done

ee ' previously by the head of the FPCC on his trip to Cuba in December 1962. The
note-taking in connection with the photos will be a device enabling Subject to
record intel information difficult to remember.

5. I briefed Subject during a two_hour perjod using as a guide the attached

requirements outline, prepared with(Henry Ki Chens) SAS/Intel/Requirements,
_and Antia Potocki, SAS/CI/Sov-Sat. Ihad also discussed Subject's mission to

Cuba with SAS/SO/Rodriguez and DC/SAS/EOB, I stressed, as did the FBI

case officer, that while fully exploiting his militia and other contacts for the

desired information, he must always be guided by security considerations,

After an agent role for three years, Subject expressed confidence in his ability t.

an carryimg out his mission successfully. :

6. I should add that I was very cordially received at the NYC FBI office
and that Mr. Schwant was most cooperative. I referred to our memorandum
to his headquarters indicating that the Agency had a world-wide programy to ae
send controlled CP and front penetrations missions to Cuba, and I expressed
the hope that this might be only our first joint effort, He agreed wholeheartedly,
adding that he personally would be particularly happy to cooperate if Subject
informant should move permanently to Cuba and play the role of resident agent,
As soon as Subject returns from Cuba Mr, Schwant will let us know and arrange
for the debriefing. ;

“SUBJECT: © | Operational Exploitation ef Khr ushchey Visit to Cuba

t. This memorandum is for the Director's information only and does
not cequire action.

; 2. An invitation by the Government af Cuba to Khrushchev to visit
‘that country hae been officially accepted, but as yet no definite time has
been set. There has been speculation that Khrushchev would arrive In
Habana for the 26th of July celebrations, while a press report, confirming
a statement of the Soviet Ambassador in Mexice, predicts the arrival for
August. Earlier reports had suggested December 1660 or January 1741
as possible dates.

3, Rois felt that a successful visit by Shrushcheyv te Cuba would assist
further in the establishment af a solid Soviet understanding with that country,
with distarbing overtones on the possible establishment of claser Soviet
relationships in other parte of Latin America, For this reason it ie
desirable to prevent the visit er te counteract it by a show of massive

|sppeattion by the Cuban people.

4, On2}) Jane the Habana Station was asked for its views on possiiic

plans. in the exchange of cables that has followed, the Station and Neadqucster:

are pow In agreement that the best course of action lies in two operations.
Flest, a massive church manifestation or rally to be called for some othe:
purnoss would afford the people of Cuba an obvious way to exprese their
protest. Second, the instigation of rarnors that Khrushchev's life will be

\is danger while in Guba from a well-planned assassination attempt wonld
be progagated from other Latin American countries. ,

5S. Because of the need of avelding action in Cuba iin this eratter ths
would imperil Station assets, 1 has been detesiiined that such asaets
be used only aa a means of iustigating the church to hold the sally.

6. The latest report from Habana indicaics that plans are going

Subject: Khrushchev Visit to Cuba

“1. B&ekground. An invitation to visit Cuba has been extended
to Khrushchev by the Governnent of Cuba, The invitation has been

' accepted, but do definite time has been set. There has been sons

speculation that Khrushchev would arrive in Havana in time for the
celebrations of the 26th of July. The press has reported that he
will arrive in August (a date confirmed by a statement of the Soviet
‘Ambassador in Mexico), Other reports say the visit will not teke
place for several months, probably in December or January. In any
event we must plan for tne possibility of the July visit.

It has been stated from several sanguine quarters that we
should "do the same thing to Khrushchev. that the Japs did to Eisen-
‘hower", This is a completely unrealistic drean,

It is true that s successful Khrushchev visit to Cuba
would be the final stoxs in the construction of a solid Soviet
base in Cuba, with disturbing overtones for the pessible construction
for more Soviet ideoligical bases in all.of Latin America, For that
reason we are trying to do what we can to prevent the visit, or at
least to show a naseive sk opposition to it. —

2. ExploitatianPlang. On 21 dune Hgs sent a cable to Havana
‘asking for views on possibility of a major effort to force cancellation
of the vielt. A resulting series of cables shows thst the station and
headquarters are now in agreement that our best hope lies in

a. A massive Church manifestation or rally, which
though called for some other purpose, would be to the pecple
of Cuba an obvious way to express their protest. And

b. from outside Cuba, instigating of rwaors that
Khrushchev’s life will be in danger fem from a well-plenned
assassination attenpt.

.3. Mr. Helms has tcld X us that he wants CIA to undertake no
action that will imperil Station essets, This injunction was placed
on us while we were exchanging cables with Havana. The result is that
station agsets are actively instigatirg the church to hold the rally.
A BREZESSE cable from Headquarters has instructed the station to
continue this course of action as long as there is “safety in numbers",
i.e., as long as it is a church action rather that an AMPALM one.

will take plhace.....Rivas, a friend of Rudy Gomez, is using the
same £etietoxwexteerx technique through three Cubans living in Miami
who are constant contact with Cuba.

Speculation on the assassination sttempts will be surfaced
on the WRUL program, in AMPACA'S paper, etc.

30 October 1975 —

MEMORANDUM FOR ‘THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Chief, éL Meeting. with Mr. Paul. Wallach, Chief
oe ; Counsel of Senate Select Committee: on Intel-
ligence: .

This meeting occurred on Wednesday, 29 October 1975
as a result of concern on the.part of Senate Select -
Committee officers that the Agency.was not forthcoming
with. file material related to the Lee Harvey Oswald case,
i.e., ‘the assassination of President. Kennedy. The
following points | were made by ‘the principals -as indicated. |

‘Chief; “CI - To open ‘the meeting ‘Mr. Kalaris made it.clear
that the Agency is anxious. to demonstrate that we ‘have
nothing to hide and that all pertinent material was made
available to the Warren Commission. He added that the
procedure for making material available to the Senate
Staff posed certain problems with regard to sources,

. methods and liaison, which were delaying the turnover of

bo material. He then presented several examples of the
sanitization process in-which cables. taken directly from
the 201 file were edited so that all evidence of: source,
method and liaison information was removed.

Chief Counsel.- As. an opening reply Mr. Wallach stated

that his position was that he considered that the Senate
Committee should have the same access as the Rockefeller
Commission. He added that in his discussions with several
senators on his committee they had mentioned reports that
a Rockefeller reviewing official by the name of Belin who
had had access to the original file,had appeared on several
talk shows and was going to write a book based on his
review of Agency holdings on the Oswald case.

Chief, ‘cr - “Mr. Kalaris then pointed out that there were
certain particularly sensitive aspects of the material
which could not be released for use outside of the building.

*

He gave two examples. of. this. One was the fact that the:
Mexican Government security (liaison) contact on the case.
was the (current_President of Mexico. He said, and Mr.
Wallach agreed, this was obviously a matter which had to.

be. protected. The second. case was the \Mexican Governi ent

- penetration of the Cuban Embassy. Again Mr. ‘Wallach *

agreed.

Chief, CI - Mr. Kalaris then suggested that the answer |.

might very well be for the Senate Committee review officers

to work with the. original file with the exception of those
particularly sensitive items which ‘would either be steri-
lized or summarized. Mr. Kalaris added that to establish
the sensitivity of these items he would be willing for

the sterilizations/summarizations to be spot checked against
the ‘originals by the Senate reviewers.

Chief Counsel - Mr. Wallach conferred with his colleagues

and then agreed that this would be acceptable. He did

inquire as to approximately how many such items there would
be. He was informed by Mr. Kalaris that it was somewhat
difficult to access but that there should not be more than
100 such items.

‘Chief Counsel - Mr. Wallach commented that it would be

necessary for his people to take notes, but he would agree
that. these notes not be taken from the building, The -
purpose of the notes is.simply to allow the reviewers. to
keep track of where they have been and what they have seen.
It was agreed at a minimum that their notes would be ‘checked
with us.

Chief, cr - At this point Mr. Kalaris called Mr. Blee and

: requested approval of the above procedure. Mr. Blee

concurred.

Chief Counsel - Mr. Wallach commented that his people would
tab those sterilized or summarized items which they wanted
‘to discuss and we would confer with them on those points.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
SUBJECT: Supplementary Information on James Harl. Ray

REFERENCE: DDO Memorandum for DCI dated 23 October 1975
Subject: Background for Rather Interview -
James Earl Ray

Dick Ober (then in CI) who wrote all-the early Ray cables,
recalls that he had numerous discussions with the FBI on the
matter, and is certain that whatever we did was undertaken at
the request of the FBI. Because of the fast moving situation,
most of his- discussions with the FBI were on the phone, and
not the subject of written memoranda. The paper clipped
‘outgoing cable in referring to Eric Galt (the man initially
identified by the FBI as the assassin of Dr. King) requests
"addressees make every effort determine if Galt is or has
been in your area. Information para one should be passed
to liaison and any other likely sources. FBI requests that
any information reported be evaluated as to reliability and
that as much detail as possible be provided. Cable any
positive reply priority to HQS. and pass to legal attache
if any in your country." ‘There is a scribbled note in the
file, presumably in Ober's hand, which reads: "4. Ray
fingerprints: FBI agreed to my proposal we send to field
for liaison." Ober, also logically points out that the FBI
would not have provided us later with a fingerprint formula
(see attached cable), a detailed physical description and
photos unless they wanted this passed on to overseas liaison
services.. (Note that our cables did not go, for ‘example, to

Ottawa or Mexico City/)

(8: AS HOS IS AWARE, STATION CONTINUES TO CONDUCT JOINT
TELTAP OPERATIONS WITH MEXICAN LIAISON AGAINST THE RUSSIAN AND
CUBAN EMBASSIES; HOWEVER, THE TAKE ON THE CUBANS IS VERY
LIMITED. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF INITIATING A
UNILATERAL TELTAP OP AGAINST THE CUBAN EMBASSY AND SEVERAL
RESIDENCES. THUS, ANY OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF WHERE TELTAP
TAPES ON OSWALD WERE DERIVED WOULD HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON
CURRENT LIAISON RELATIONSHIP. THE MEXICAN LIAISON SERVICES AND .
SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO BE SENSITIVE RE THE
NWBOLTON RELATIONSHIP, AND THERE ARE THOSE WITHIN THESE RANKS
WHO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE MEXICANS SHOULD HAVE ANYTHING
MORE THAN A FORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH NWBOLTON. STATION BELIEVES
THAT ANY EXPOSURE (WHETHER OLD OR NEW) AT THIS STAGE OF THE
LIAISON RELATIONSHIP (A NEW REGIME IS COMING TO POWER) WOULD
FORCE THE MEXICANS TO REASSESS THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AS
WELL AS QUESTION OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A DISCREET AND

PROTECTED RELATIONSHIP. (IT WOULD ALSO GIVE OUR DETRACTORS THE
EXCUSE TO FURTHER REDUCE OR COMPLETELY BREAK OFF THE
RELATIONSHIP.) GIVEN THE HIGH INTEREST OF POLICYMAKERS IN

“THE KGB SPIES WHO CAME IN FOR THE GOLD

“WITH NO HINT OF SHAME, THE COLD WAR SPY MASTERS

SAID THEIR MEMOIRS CAN BE HAD FOR CASH--ON EVERYTHING

THAT STOLE THE SECRETS OF THE ATOM BOMB FROM AMERICA.

“'THE IDEA THAT ALL PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN ESPIONAGE

VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSOCIATION OF KGB VETERANS OF
FOREIGN ESPIONAGE, OR FIVA, AS THE RUSSIANS CALL IT.

"MR. PRIVALOV AND THREE COLLEAGUES FROM THE ELITE OF

"FEAR OF POVERTY HAD SPURRED THE RETIRED SPIES TO
SIGN UP WITH THE HOLLYWOOD FIRM ENTERTAINMENT AND
COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS ASSOCIATION TO PEDDLE THEIR
INSIDE HISTORY OF THE COLD WAR FOR FILMS, MINISERIES AND
DOCUDRAMAS .

"DUE TO THE PRESENT CONFUSION IN OUR COUNTRY, MANY
OF THE VETERANS ARE IN A VERY DIFFICULT (FINANCIAL)
SITUATION,’ MR. PRIVALOV SAID.

"OLEG NECHIPERENKO, A 25-YEAR KGB VETERAN, SAID HIS
FORTHCOMING BOOK WILL GIVE DETAILS OF HIS TWO MEETINGS
WITH<LEE HARVEY OSWALD>IN MEXICO CITY TWO MONTHS BEFORE
OSWALD SHOT<PRESIDENT KENNEDY. >

"THE OSWALD MEETINGS TOOK PLACE SEPT. 27-28, 1963,
ON THE INITIATIVE OF OSWALD, SAID MR. NECHIPERENKO, THEN
KGB STATION CHIEF IN MEXICO CITY.

""HIS MOOD WAS BAD,’ SAID MR. NECHIPERENKO.

"BUT, HE TEASED, ‘THE OSWALD HE MET IN MEXICO CITY
WAS THE SAME ONE WHO WAS IN DALLAS.

"ANOTHER NECHIPERENKO TIDBIT: TWO OTHER KGB MEN
WERE PRESENT AT THE INTERVIEW AND AN OPERATIVE IN MOSCOW
WAS KEPT ABREAST OF THE DISCUSSIONS.

“EXHIBITING FAMILIARITY WITH OLIVER STONE’S MOVIE
* <'JFK,'>MR. NECHIPERENKO SAID HE WOULD AGREE WITH ‘SOME OF
THE CONCLUSIONS OF JAMES GARRISON,’ BUT ONLY BASED ON THE
FORMER NEW ORLEANS DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S BOOK, NOT ON ANY
EVIDENCE.

"IF HE HAD THE DOCUMENTS, MR. NECHIPERENKO SAID, HE

COULD GIVE A BETTER VERDICT. OF COURSE, NO TALK OF SUCH

* AN<ASSASSINATION>TOOK PLACE IN MEXICO CITY AND THERE WAS
NO ENCOURAGEMENT OF SUCH A DEED, HE SAID.

"MR. NECHIPERENKO HAS BEEN TROTTED OUT BEFORE BY THE
KGB ALONG WITH YURI MODIN, THE HANDLER OF KIM PHILBY, THE
BRITISH MASTER SPY WHO WORKED FOR THE SOVIETS. PHILBY
DIED IN MOSCOW IN 1988.

"THE NEW FACE SHOWN WEDNESDAY WAS ANATOLY YAZKOV,
CODE-NAMED ‘YAKOVLEV’ IN HIS WORLD WAR II YEARS IN
AMERICA WHEN HE HELPED RUN THE SPY RING THAT GAVE JOSEF
STALIN THE ATOM BOMB. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
ESPIONAGE PENETRATIONS IN HISTORY.

"BUT MR. YAZKOV, BEYOND ADMITTING THAT HE WORKED OUT
OF THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE AT 7 E. 61ST ST. IN NEW YORK
CITY, ACROSS FROM THE HOTEL PIERRE, WAS SINGULARLY

' GUILTY, MR. YAZKOV SAID HE PREFERRED ‘NOT TO TALK ABOUT
PEOPLE WHO TOOK PART IN THIS OR MIGHT HAVE TAKEN PART IN
THIS.

"TT WAS NOT THE BEST ADVERTISEMENT FOR HIS
FORTHCOMING WORK. .

"WHEN ASKED IF HE MISSED THE COLD WAR, MR. YAZKOV
REPLIED, ‘THANK GOD THAT IT IS OVER.’

"UNCONTRITE, HE INSISTED HE WAS ’'NOT SPYING AGAINST
AMERICA, BUT IN SUPPORT OF THE SOVIET UNION IN ORDER TO
BALANCE THE TWO POWERS.’

"ABOUT 5,000 FORMER KGB OPERATIVES ARE MEMBERS OF
THE ASSOCIATION.

"'WHEN A PERSON LEAVES HIS POST, HE IS LEFT ALL
ALONE,’ SAID MR. PRIVALOV, A 42-YEAR KGB VETERAN. ‘SO IN
ORDER THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT FEEL THEMSELVES ABANDONED, WE
DECIDED TO UNITE AND TO ORGANIZE A CLUB WHERE VETERANS

COULD COME TO RELAX, TO DRINK A BEER OR A WHISKEY, AS THE
ASSOCIATION OF THE CIA DOES.

"INSTEAD OF FEELING SORRY FOR THEMSELVES, THE FORMER
CLOAK-AND-DAGGER MEN WILL WORK ON A FILM ABOUT THE ATOM
BOMB SPY RING; A TV MINISERIES ABOUT U.S. NAVY EMPLOYEE
GLENN MICHAEL SOUTHER, A SOVIET SPY WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE
IN MOSCOW IN 1989; AND A DOCUMENTARY ON OSWALD’S BIZARRE
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KGB.

* "DOCUDRAMAS ON THE<ASSASSINATION>OF LEON TROTSKY AND
THE CASE OF NATO OFFICIAL ROBERT LEE JOHNSON, KNOWN AS
‘THE AMERICAN KIM PHILBY,’ ARE ALSO PLANNED."

FOR THE RECORD, WE HAVE NOTED THAT SOME SIMILAR
THREADS RUN THROUGH BOTH THIS ARTICLE AND THE LWOPUS CA:

D>

A. THE TIMING OF THE OFFER BY THE FIVA GROUP ON
WEDNESDAY, 25 MARCH, FALLS DIRECTLY INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE
WINDOW ESTABLISHED BY LWOPUS (24-26 MARCH). ALSO, LWOPUS
NOTED THAT IF THERE WERE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT GETTING THE
MANUSCRIPI-ACROSS THE LITHUANIAN BORDER, HE WOULD RESORT TO A

—

:— Sreserve VARIANT BUT WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OTHER PAI
T I.E., HE WOULD APPROACH SOMEONE~ ELSE . —

as a

ES,

B. LWOPUS SENT A SAMPLE OF HIS WORK TO US NOT FOR

PUBLICATION BUT FOR A CRITICAL READING. HE STATED THAT IF A ’

PUBLISHING HOUSE SHOWED INTEREST IN HIS MANUSCRIPT, AGREEMENT “~~.
a



Page 4:
13-00000 -

92-7827323
COULD BE REACHED REGARDING JOINT ACTIONS AND MUTUAL LEGAL
COMMITMENTS. At HOUGH—MONETARY COMPENSATION IS. IMPLIED,
LWOPUS DOES NOT MENTION ANY SPECIFIC SUM, RATHER HE SUGGESTS
THAT HE IS WILLING TO ENTER INTO SOME SORT OF CONTRACTUAL
AGREEMENT. THIS IS COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT THE FIVA GROUP
APPEARS TO BE ATTEMPTING. THE FIVA GROUP STATES IN NO
UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT THEY NEED MONEY.

C. IN EACH CASE THERE APPEARS TO BE A LARGE VOLUME
OF MATERIAL. LWOPUS STATED THAT UP TO NOW HE HAS PREPARED
SEVEN FOLDERS ON FOURTEEN COUNTRIES AND FORESEES WRITING 22-
25 SMALL BOOKS OR EPISODES ON DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE FIVA
GROUP ALSO IMPLIES THAT A LARGE VOLUME OF MATERIAL EXISTS.
LWOPUS CLAIMS THAT HIS WRITINGS WERE BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTARY

SOURCES. THE FIVA GROUP MAKES NO SUCH CLAIM, BUT IMPLIES THAT
THEIR MATERIAL IS FROM PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE.

D. BASED UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF THE
MATERIAL AND THE TIME SPAN IT ENCOMPASSES, WE SUSPECT THE
LWOPUS MANUSCRIPT MIGHT BE A JOINT EFFORT. if IT IS NOTA
JOINT EFFORT, COLLECTION MUST HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG
TIME BY SOMEONE WITH EXCELLENT ACCESS TO ARCHIVAL MATERTAL.
THE FIVA GROUP IS A COMMON EFFORT OF AT LEAST FOUR (AND
PROBABLY MORE) RETIRED KGB OFFICERS.

—E. LWOPUS NOTED THAT HE IS CONCERNED FOR HIS SAFETY
AND THAT OF HIS FAMILY. HIS FAILURE TO SHOW AT THE EMBASSY IN
VILNIUS DURING THE WINDOW MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF HIS CONCERN.
AMBASSADOR JOHNSON STATED THAT HE HAD ALREADY ALERTED THE
EMBASSY, INCLUDING THE LITHUANIAN FSN IN HIS OFFICE, THAT THEY
SHOULD BE ALERT FOR THE RETURN OF THE LWOPUS MESSENGER. IF
LWOPUS BECAME AWARE THAT THE LITHUANTAN EMPLOYEE HAD BEEN TOLD
TO WATCH FOR THE MESSENGER, HE MAY HAVE ELECTED NOT TO RETURN.
IN SUCH CASE, ASSUMING THAT YURASOV IS CONNECTED WITH THE FIVA

GROUP, THEIR OFFER TO THE HOLLYWOOD FIRM MAY BE AN ALTERNATE
PLAN.

F. IN EACH CASE, THE MATERIAL PRESENTED WOULD HAVE
APPEAL FOR THE GROUP TO WHICH IT IS OFFERED, I.E., THE OFFER
TO US OF INTELLIGENCE RELATED SNIPPETS REGARDING IN-PLACE
AGENTS VS THE OFFER TO THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY OF THE MORE
SPECTACULAR CASES THAT WOULD APPEAL TO A MASS AUDIENCE.

G. THE NAME OF YAZKOV (TRUE NAME ANATOLIY YAKOVLEV)
IS SIMILAR TO YURASOV. ALTHOUGH IT IS CERTAINLY NOT TRUE IN
EVERY CASE, THE FORMER SOVIETS FREQUENTLY USED COVER NAMES
SIMILAR TO OR WHICH HAD THE SAME FIRST LETTER AS THEIR OWN
NAME .

HT EWOPUS IS OBVIOUSLY HEDGING HIS BETS. HE-AnSe——___}
& MENTIONED 'THAT HE HAD MADE Two. PREVIOUS UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS

OF THESE -ATPEMPES;—P?—ES—NOTEWOR THY-THAT-THE-MANUSCREPE HE
PROVIDED TO US WAS A CARBON. BASED ON THE QUALITY, WE BELIEVE
THAT IT WAS NOT CARBON NUMBER ONE.

4. WE ARE CURRENTLY CHECKING THE FILES OF THE FOUR FIVA
OFFICERS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEIR BACKGROUNDS MIGHT OFFER
THEM ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION THAT LWOPUS PROVIDED. WE
ALSO PLAN TO COMPARE THE MATERIAL WE RECEIVED FROM LWOPUS TO
SEE IF THE FILES OF THESE FOUR OFFICERS INDICATE THAT THEY HAD
CONTACTS SIMILAR TO ANY OF THOSE MENTIONED IN THE LWOPUS
MATERIAL. WE WILL ADVISE YOU OF THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH.

SUBJECT: TSBRIEFING OF NAVIN M. WILSTED (ps)

on 1 June 1960 rr. (Jonn c. “teyn) ond Mr. John Kennedy of WHD,
otha Brow) of O1/oPs, Mr.(Robert Bryant)of FI/OPS and Mr4(Charles °3
FT /D mot with Navid M. WILSTED (ps) .05

WILSTED emphasized that the whole tolephone. systen in Mexico
"sty dsiundergoing a reformation. The company Telefonos de Mexico, S.A.;
- has subssontracted this work of cleaning up and reorganizing the phone
“gysten tothe independent firm, Intel. They are cleaning up unused and
, Old lines, putting in new and spare lines, redefining exchange areas,
“laying. underground cables, etc. Eventually we should be better off be-
cause: there should be more surplus lines. The renovation vork has
“hampered much of the LIF@AT work, principally because many of the Lines
“now ape underground and we carmot get access. to them before they enter
the:sontral.. This is particularly trun with respect to the Czech Emo
‘bassy,.to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
,Podnt we now occupy.

. : “3e WILSTED seid that we try to keep track of the activities of
‘ "Intel" but since they seem to attack "Colonias" at random, we have no
Prior warning of their presence in a certain area.

4. In the recent past, ‘exico has baen using houses for listing
posts for security reasons. ‘e have more control over the access of
phone company inspectors or repairman to houses. Jlowever, under new
regulations, all new apartment buildings must havo telephone lines ine
atalled in the building by the phone company during the construction
phase. This means that tho lines and their destination are concealed,
WILSTED preposed that this will mean we can again use apartments since
we can siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a
way that the phone company cannot trace ita destination without tearing
the building apart and we can then install a separate line to the build-
ing and hook. up the subscriber to this line which, if checked, will
belong to a. legitimate subscriber.

S. One system which has been used effectively is to take one-half
of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two hnlf
pairs then form one good pair which we can use.

6 WILSTED explained that it cost about 3000 pesos to get a

reguler telephone. This entails the purchase of a telephone company
bond, which later can be sold. —

Og SL hen

Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO

NOSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet
KGB officer who defected in 1964 and
was subsequently involuntarily con-
fined in the U.S. by the Agency for

a period of approximately three years.

NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-
sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962

and subsequently defected in January
1964. NOSENKO was brought to the U.S.
and after a period of relative freedom
he was involuntarily confined in

April 1964. From April 1964 to

August 1965, he was confined at an
Agency controlled site in; Clinton,
Maryland. From August 1965 to

October 1967, NOSENKO was confined

at Camp Peary, Virginia. In October
1967, he was returned to the Washington
area, given increasing amounts of
freedom until he was given total free-
dom in April 1969. NOSENKO became a
U.S. citizen in April 1974. NOSENKO
‘was employed by the Agency as a
consultant in March 1969 and continues
under contract to date. His present
salary is $23,500 per year.

(1) The legal basis to confine NOSENKO
against his will was discussed by

Mr. Richard Helms, DD/P, and others with
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Houston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
proper (Tab 2).

(2) There are a series of letters from
the DDCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Department of
Justice and the White House, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, evidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3).

(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's confine-
ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 § 5).

RESULTS

TERMINATION

COMMENTS

By memorandum dated 2 October 1968,
the Director of Security forwarded
two reports to the DDCI summarizing
the results of the NOSENKO case to
that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI.
Both reports. conclude that NOSENKO
was a bona fide defector. A draft
memorandum attached to this. file,
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raises question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides

and challenges the above two reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

the Agency. He is brought to Washington
periodically to consult on matters
germane to his background and experience.
Various reports are available in the
files of the Office of: Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.

No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

do document the rationale for the original
confinement of NOSENKO, they do not
document the rationale for his continued
confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated 5 August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document
a period in. 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3). During the above period, NOSENKO

was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
During this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at least two
occasions.

Dear. ( Anthony)
; Re arding your letter 67705) of 10 May 1982, our. ..
"records indicat t. Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov’
traveled to Mexico, France, Spain, the U.S. and Cuba

during the period 1959-61. In 1961, he was assigned
permanently to Mexico City as a consular officer and
served there until August 1965. He was varigusly
described as a translator, vice-consul, and attache.
During this tour he attempted to cultivate a U.S.
Government employee assigned to'our embassy in Mexico

City. goof

pelm “6

In September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald
approached ‘the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt
to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR...
Kostikov, as a consular officer, handled this visa
request. We have no information which indicates ‘any
relationship between these individuals other than for the
purpose of Oswald's making his visa request.

Kostikov returned to Mexico City for a second tour of
duty in July 1968. During this tour he was again assigned
to the consular section and was a second secretary. It
appeared that he was tasked with following the activities
of the Central American communist parties,-dnd left-wing
groups, and he met often with members of “these groups,
reportedly providing them with funds and technical
guidance. In July/August 1969, Kostikov made an unusual
TDY trip to Moscow lasting three weeks. (His family
remained in Mexico.) In July 1970 he made a four-day trip
to Havana.

Kostikov's tour in Mexico ended unexpectedly in
September 1971. Our information indicated that he wae
not due to leave for another three to four months, and at
the time of his departure, there was some speculation that
the suddenness of his departure was due to the fact. that

he was known to (Lyalin}-

While in Mexico he was considered by some to be the
most effective and dangerous of intelligence officers in
Mexico. He has been described as being without morals,

education, and manners. Shortly after his arrival in
Mexico in 1968, he was arrested in front of a house of
prostitution after becoming involved in a fist fight with
some locals. It appears.this incident did not affect his

‘position in Mexico City, despite the fact that it
received a good deal of press coverage.

We are aware only that Kostikov arrived in Beirut in
June 1978. We are unable to confirm his presence there
' now. : :

Although our file indicates that Kostikov may have
been a member of Department.13 (Executive Action)
(Department V's predecessor), we have been unable to

confirm this. Also, to the best of our knowledge the KGB
has not engaged in such executive action since 1959,

6. Samvel WISE, "Counsel in the American Embussy i
is referred to above, may well be Samuel. Griffin Wis
SD & SED, who apparently was once a contract employee on ARACEIVE.
[fhe Etate Depar' tment veviewed WISE's file on 2 June 1954; and
September 1962 a Samuel G. WISE was Second Secretary of the Ame
Pees in Moscow. % that time WISE advised in a cable to the

“DAVIS' case is very similar to that of
OSWALD; and he, like OSUALD, lived in the Soviet. Union for two years
after his defection end. prior to making application 1 for return to the
United States wi :

7. WISE was an applicant for CIA employment in early 1953 and
was security approved subject to polysraph on 11 August 1993. He aid
not enter on duty and in September 1953 the office which had been
interested in him was "no longer interested". On 13 November 1953,
WISE was granted a CSA to permit his use as a contract employee on
AEACTIVE in New York City. His CSA was cancelled on 2) March 1958.

8. WISE was nawed as a friend of William Orville MUNSELL, 461693-DL, .
during an investigation of the latter for possible CIA employment in 1952.

only person she knew by name with whon ‘MUNSELL was ‘friendly. Accord
to the informant, WISE was a student at Columbia University whose addrass |
was 423 Furnald Hall. MUNSELL was Security disapproved for CIA employx: rent
in June 1952 because of his close association on a professional and social
basis, while attending Denver University from 1946 to 1951, with person#

of questionable loyality. In November 1954, MUNSELL was of interest to
project FJALIVE with reference to assignment tof Dhahran, “Saudi Arabia;
however, the interested office withdrew their requést on him, after
Security edvised of the derogatory information regarding him.

9. WISE from 1951 to 1954 attended Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale,
New York, which was attacked by a Citizen's Group, which alleged Commmist
influence in the school system. He had several questionable associates in
addition to MUNSELL. ;

Cuban Exile Activities

on January 28, 1960, PSI MIGUEL ANDRES DE LEON ROJAS
reported that responsible Cuban exile groups,in Mexico City and
the United States, who have supp ed Dr. LIO 2 PORTUONDO,
are convinced that General JOS ERI DRAZSACABRERA, who
commands a group of Cuban military exiles in the Dominican
Republic, would not be a wise selection as the military leader
of the attempt to overthrow the CASTRO government. ‘The PSI
further scipeea, hat these Cuban exile groups believe that
PEDRO LUISMDIA Z, former Chief of, the Cuban Air. Force,
would be a much better military leader. (' AW ,

The PSI also advised that information received from .
sources within Cuba reflected that FIDEL CASTRO had prepared a
decree ordering the United States to vacate the Guantanamo
Naval Base. According to this information, the decree was
originally prepared in late November, 1959, but had not yet

been signed for issuance. (2) OY + ge fh

The PSI further reported at he had Heard reports in
Miami, Florida, of an invasion a pt which allegedly would
be made by supporters of ROLANDOAMASFERRER,! a Cuban exile who

resides i ami. The PSI, stated that MASFERRER, ROBERTO

APERNANDES DA, NO OTHMAN, and their associates form a

group which is mae regarded in a favorable light by responsible
Cuban exiles or by responsible elements within Cuba. The PSI
stated that from the information available to him in Miami he
doubted very much that MASFERRER would be able to make an
attempt at invading Cuba or, if an attempt were made, that it
would be successful. “(&) J)

Nicaragua

PSI DE LEON also advised on January 28 that he had
eceived information from within Cuba that ERNESTO "CHE"
UEVARA has not abandoned his project to utiTize pro-Communist
éavaguan exiles and~Cuban "volunteers" in an attempt to

invade Nicaragua. This source advised that approximately 400
guerrillas have been trained to make up the invasion force.

The PSI stated he had received no information as to the timing
of such an attempt, but expressed doubt that it would occur in
the immediate future in view of the concern of the Cuban Govern-

ment over a possible early invasion attempt by Cuban exiles. (94(4)

will not only benefit Mexico but its sister Latin American
countries who are bound together not only by historical ties
but by the same economic and social conditions and identical
perspectives. In apparent reference to DAVID ALFARO SIQUEIROS, “444i; :
leading PCM figure, he stated that some people, who are bles:
, to understand national and international politics altho -
they xpound them daily, have been critical of / LOPEZ

' trip. During the course of the President's trip ”
SIQUETROS made a statement to the press wherein he criticized
the President for not accepting a bid to visit Cuba and stated
that President LOPEZ MATEOS was merely laying the ground work
for a subsequent visit by President EISENHOWER. LOMBARDO was
eritical of President LOPEZ MATEOS in certain respects,
particularly in connection with the imprisonment of the
railroad strike agitators and PCM and POCM leaders,

BETANCOURT indicated that he had been the General
Coordinator of the 30th of November anti-Castro organization
in Cuba during 1959, 1960 and the first part of 1961. He
arrived in the United States at Miami on June 29, 1961, via
small boat. Upon his arrival in the United States, he assumed
leadership of the 30th of November movement in Miami until
approximately October, 1962, when he entered the U. S. Army
under the Cuban recruitment program at Fort Jackson, S. C.
Subsequent to this, he has been affiliated with the 30th of
November movement in Chicago for approximately two years,
1963-1965, and in Miami, 1965 to date.

BETANCOURT is currently employed_as a security guard
for the ie National 1 Patrol Detective Agency and the National
Industrial Security Corporation (affiliates), 590 S. W.27th
Avenue, Miami, Florida. In connection with this employment,
he is a guard at the Cuban Refugee Pr. 1s
Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) three days
la week. The Processing Center is located in Buildings T-90
and T~94 which are utilized by the U. S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) in processing, fingerprinting and
States. Ye ing Cuban refugees upon their arrival in the United
States. GH the guise NS interviewers] interrogates 6)

these arrivals fat this. location).

BETANCOURT related he met ROBLEJO around the first
of January, 1967, when ROBLEJO reportedly returned from Mexico
City where he had been attempting to seek the release of Cuban

\P boliticar prisoners in Cuba. He met ROBLEJO through ANGEL...

—LESTEVEZ, a coworker of BETANCOURT at the Hotel Fontainebleau

7

NGREFS both were employed as waiters at that time.” At’ the
request of ESTEVEZ, BETANCOURT furnished ROBLEJO a table gratis
at the Frank Sinatra. show at the Fontainebleau Hotel, for which
ROBLEJO was apparently grateful. As a result of this, ROBLEJO
sought BETANCOURT'’s assistance in attempting to obtain the
release of political prisoners and recently BETANCOURT was
made a member of the Executive Committee of the CPLLC.

In this connection, BETANCOURT accompanied ROBLEJO

to San Juan, Puerto Rico, the first week of June, 1967.

BETANCOURT by this time had the impression ROBLEJO was actually
anti-United States and he considered ROBLEJO a "leftist-socialist."
VeRESG in_Puerto Rico, they met with MANOL ARAY and ‘RUFOSROR 2EZu.-.

RESQUET. ROBLEJO discussed the possibility of RAY and LOPEZ
FRESQUET becoming active in seeking the release of Cuban

political prisoners. However, no definite agreement or

conclusion was reached.

BETANCOURT stated that on or about June 15, 1967,
he and ROBLEJO, while temporarily staying at 2930 “Loiza,
Santurce, Puerto Rico, were having a general conversation and
ROBLEJO changed the topic to BETANCOURT's current work as a
security guard at the Miami Airport where the Cuban refugees
are processed, ROBLEJO asked detailed questions concerning
the nature of the activities-at~this-tocation, to which BETANCOURT
explained that Cuban refugees upon their arrival in the United
States are processed here’, including having their photographs
taken, being fingerprinted, and being interrogated. ROBLEJO
asked BETANCOURT if the FBI was there, which BETANCOURT acknowl-
edged in the affirmative, and ROBLEJO asked, "What do they do
there?" BETANCOURT answered, “They investigate and clear all
of the refugees © arriving from Cuba in the United States."
ROBLEJO was interested in knowing if BETANCOURT saw "those papers"
and BETANCOURT stated he had seen them, (BETANCOURT indicated
this was entirely fictitiois, but since he did not trust ROBLEJO,
he felt he might be in a position to be of possible assistance
to the U. S. Government). ROBLEJO asked BETANCOURT if he could
“photograph...take a picture of the documents or the people
the FBI investigates." BETANCOURT asked ROBLEJO if he was
"crazy," stating that if he did something like that, he could
be put in the “electric chair.” ROBLEJO indicated that with
the use of a smali camera, this could be accomplished very
easily. Almost immediately, the topic was changed and BETANCOURT

‘indicated to ROBLEJO he had to leave San Juan immediately because

his child had just broken his collar bone. BETANCOURT also
indicated to ROBLEJO that his, BETANCOURT's, wife had called
and said she did not have any money in the house to buy food,
etc. At this point, ROBLEJO gave BETANCOURT a check in the
amount of $300.00, drawn on the First National Bank of Miami,

on the account of the Committee of Relatives of the One Hundred.
ROBLEJO made .out this check in BETANCOURT's presence and
requested $50.00 be given to ROBLEJO's mother. Immediately,
BETANCOURT cashed the check and sent a money order to his wife,
ERMITAS RAMON ARIAS. :

BETANCOURT stated ROBLEJO had given him $50.00 in
cash prior to their departure. for Puerto Rico.

BETANCOURT advised he returned to Miami from Puerto
Rico on June 18, 1967, and ROBLEJO remained in San Juan until
June 28, 1967. He recalled ROBLEJO attempted to have him stay
in Puerto Rico and was “mad" at BETANCOURT for leaving early.

On June 30, 1967, ROBLEJO telephonically contacted
BETANCOURT, during which conversation ROBLEJO indicated he

in obtaining a Mexican visa in order to go to Cuba to possibly
converse with FIDEL CASTRO or other important leaders in the
communist government of Cuba in connection with the possible
release of Cuban political prisoners.

Memo to Mr. Belmont SEE a] Re: Central Intelligence Agency
: Information Received from James
Angleton

-Intelligence @ivision. Angleton handles special cases of a various
nature and he is usually given considerable freedom and leeway in
directing the operations of his_unit. In general, he is responsible
only to the Director of CIA. e has numerous foreign sources and
channels for developing infor ton. The primary source is the[Tsraeli
Intelligence Service.§S\In addition to this, he is tn contact with
5\/Jay Lovestone who pértodically makes available to Angleton copies
reports which Lovestone} has received from Anerican Federation of (8) g)
Labor} representa tves throughout the world. “Phese representatives)
are @ssociated with the Free .Trade Union Committee, which is cud. ©
sidized by the CIA. Angleton also has indépendent sources in the
intelligence services of France, Italy, Greece, and Great Britain.
On occasion he utilizes sources in the Vatican. Some of the men
under his control are on various foreign assignments in Europe and
are responsible only to him. Most of them are traveling under.
- commercial cover.

During the past several months Angleton has been very
cooperative with the Bureau. He has volunteered voluminous infor-
mation of interest to the Bureau and he has followed Bureau leads
tn an effective manner. Much of the information which Angleton
has furnished appears in the raw form, that is, it consists of the
actual reports received from Angleton's sources. This has been of
advantage because the Bureau has been in a position to better evaluate
the information instead of waiting for the delay and processing through
normal channels in the CIA. In addition to information regarding
Security matters furnished by Angleton, he has also been of valuable
assistance by keeping the Liaison Agent apprised of administrative
changes and reorganization within the CIA. Angleton is thoroughly \
informed regarding the foreign intelligence activities of his agency
and he frequently clarifies matters which the CIA_sometimes camouflages
with some of its cloak and dagger techniques. ty u)

For your information, Angleton was instructed by General.
Walter Bedell Smith, while he was still Director of the CIA, [to u)
cooperate fully with the Liaison Agent and was told that he,
Angleton, could disseminate any information he saw fits] This policy
has continued under Allen Dulles.

Since the volume of information received from Angleton U

has increased the Liaison Agent has endeavored to encourage Angleton
to establish some uniformity in the dissemination of information to

Z AS you are aware, James Angleton of CFA frequently turns
over to the Bureau on a highly confidential basis information which
has been developed through operations headed by Angleton, In many
instances the information is given to the Bureau without clearing |
through regular CIA channels. In almost all instances it is given
to us with the clear understanding that if ineluded in a report or
other communication prepared for dissemination outside the Bureau
the information will be so set forth that it cannot be traced back
to either ‘Angleton CIA. kin such instances where the jnformagion
relates.toffsraeli tters/%t has been the practice opftsroets ‘s)
supervisors to cléar with Angleton before disseminatin information
from him owtside the Bureau.”

os In taking up such a matter with Angleton last week it
Qwas determined that he objected to attributing information which

YRS overnment which conducts personnel and intelligence investigations,"

which conducts personnel and intelligence investigations the Bureau

iN the information had originated with CIA sinee such an individual

could be described as being of known reliability. ,

report should be attributed to an informant with a temporary symbol
number, which informant could be evaluated as having furnished in-
formation of a reliable nature in the past. On the informant page
the temporary symbol number could be identified by the regular.

last name was a member of Yugoslav Intelligence Service (YIS).
However, another source of CIA advised subject was not a member of
YIS, CIA has learned that an individual believed to be the subject

is being recalled to Yugoslavia, but this individual wishes to
remain in the U. 8.

21A desires verification of this information
because if it is true/CIA may wish to consider contacting subject
in an effort to persuade him to return to Yugoslavia under wntrol
of cia, (Bbabjece is supposed to return to Yugoslavia at end of
April, 1963 Nv Approach te subject by FBI is not recommended because
New York informants said in March, 1963, subject is net engaged in

intelligence activities and because State recently denied clearance
for approach in similar case.

A highly confidential informant who tarnish Peliate A

information in the past recently advised thafon about February 20, 1963,{5)
Raul Roa, Cuban Foreign Minister, commented that the Sino - Indian , .,
conflict continually bothers Cuba and this conflict worked in the favor *
of the United States in the Pall of 1963.

3 Roa's evaluation of the situation in Cuba was highly pessimistic. “
: Roa stated that the situation has deteriorated; that this was the only thing
hat could have happened because talks at the United Nations, New York,
= did not find an answer to the problem. Roa also observed that conditions
as of February, 1963, were similar to those just before the crisis in the
Fall of 1062, mentioning pirate boat activities, a campaign in the United
States and a statement by President Kennedy which Roa described as
meaningless. .

~ +#

Roa commented that the United States wag the only nation which
benefited from the crisis. The informant understood that it was Roa's
contention that by excluding the Security Council of the United Nations .
from considering the Cuban situation and permitting the Organization of oo
. American States (OAS) to take up the matter freely, the United States
‘ is now enjoying a very favorable position in the OAS, the best it has enjoyed/»

| at any time in the Organization. In still referring to what the informant
| believed was the OAS, Roa said that the report of the Antisubversive
Committee, now under study by the OAS, contains some definite proposals,
such as a collective breakoff and a breakoff in relations with Cuba including
postal contacts. Roa said it is known officially that Mexico will accept
such resolutions with reservations; Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay will accept
everything; and it is’ believed that only Brazil will oppose such resolutions.
Cuba, according to Roa, believes thaf talks between President Kennedy and
President Romulo Betancourt, Venezuela; will establish the action by the

Roa also commented that it would have been much better if the
Cuban situation had been handled by the United Nations Security Council.
Among other things, this would have limited the ability of the OAS,
When it was suggested that time wae working in Cuba's favor, Roa
agreed, saying it permitted internal consolidation, and economic and
organizational endeavors. He also mentioned the differences within
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the hope for settlement of
differenees in the Soviet Bloc and prospects for general relaxing of
strained relations between all countries. | .

Although Rea did not mention the Soviet. Union at any time, it
appeared that he does not now agree with the Soviet Union's placing
missiles in Cuba in 1962. Roa's comments during the entire conversation
left one with the feéling that he was pessimistic, according to. the informant. |

daily movements while in Mexico City nor could they confirm the date
of his departure or his mode of travel. The original assumption that
he had returned by bus could not be proven. Several possibilities were
discussed whereby the Commission could fill in the gaps of its investi-
gation of the Mexican phase. The suggestion was made that the most
effective way of resolving the questions they had would be to have a
member of the Commission visit Mexico City and discuss the issues on
the spot with those American and Mexican officials directly concerned.
Mr. Helms noted that it would be possible for a member of the Com-
mission to visit our Chief of Station who would then be able to work out
with the Warren Commission staff member the best way to handle inter-
views with Mexican police officials, particularly if it is desired that
these interviews be informal in nature. Our Chief of Station would also
be able to put the Warren Commission staff member in contact with the
FBI officials and Immigration and Naturalization Ser ice offi tationed

Department of the planne visit and upon arrival to meet briefly with the
Ambassador or Minister Counselor before proceeding to work out details
with the CIA Chief of Station.

8. In connection with the Mexican phase of the investigation, mem-
bers of Mr. Rankin's staff questioned Mr. Helms and Mr. Rocca regarding
the extent of the CIA file on Oswald for the period 8 October to 22 November
1963. They questioned the sanitized extracts which they had been shown
and wondered if there were not more. Mr. Rocca summarized the ma-° ~
terials that had come to the attention of the Secret Service, or had been
disseminated to the Secret Service, immediately after the assassination,
Mr. Rocca said there was not additional substantive information and that
the sanitized version seen by the Commission constituted the sum of our
holdings. Mr. Helms then explained that as a matter of practice we did
’ not release actual copies of our messages because they contained code-

words and digraphs which would be unintelligible to a person not familiar
with them, He added, however, that he would be happy to show the file
with the original messages to any staff member of the Warren Commission
who might come to visit him at Langley.

9. The question of why no action was taken by other agencies of
the government after their receipt of CIA information that Oswald was
in contact with the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City was next
discussed. Mr. Rankin and members of his staff clearly felt that this
was a crucial question which needed careful review. They appeared to

HW 50955 Docid:32202033 Page 2


Page 3:
(

believe that the information on Cswald was unusual enough to have
caused recipients to take special measures which might conceivably
have led to a closer scrutiny of Lee Harvey Oswald and his movements.
Mr. Helms pointed out that the information on Oswald's visit to the
Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City came from telephone inter-
cepts which were placed on both embassies. These intercepis were
recorded on tape and reviewed by persons at our Station for any infor-
mation affecting U. S. security. Such information is routinely passed
to other agencies and entered in CIA files. Given the enormous bulk
which is involved, the tapes are not kept on file but erased after a brief
period of time. Thus the information on Oswald was similar to that
provided on other American citizens who might have made contacts of
this type. In Oswald's case, it was the combination of visits to both
Cuban and Soviet Embassies which caused the Mexico City Station to
report this to Headquarters and Oswald's record of defection to the
Soviet Union which prompted the Headquarters dissemination. At the
conclusion of his remarks on this subject, Mr. Helms specified that
the information he had given } Mr. Rankin y was extremely sensitive

10. The Commission, Mr. Rankin said, would be interested in

any information held by CLA on Jack Ruby. Mr. Rankin said the Com-
mission staff had prepared a roundup on Ruby, a copy of which he handed
Mr. Helms. He said he would appreciate any file reflections or comments
that CIA analysts might make on tais material. Mr. Rankin and memters .
of his staff then discussed Ruby's confirmed trip to Havana in 1959. The
Commission has received information from an unspecified source that
Ruby was in Havana again in 1963 under a Czech passport. Mr. Rankin
asked whether CIA could provide any assistance in verifying this story.
Mr. bs elms replied that ¢ CIA would eé limited in its possibility of assist-

COgalins ‘93 These would be carried out he

said.

ii. Mr. Helms was then asked if CLA had done any follow up to °
its original telegraphic dissemination of the information on Oswald's
visits to the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City. Mr. Helms
replied that there had been no CIA action following our initial dissemi-
nation. Mr. Willems then asked if there were any liaison problems
faced by CIA in its efforts to deal with other agencies in matters affect-

ing internal security. Mr. Helms replied that there were always under-
standable human problems in conducting any liaison on any subject but

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. ROSTOW
SUBJECT: Meeting of the Task Force on Viet Nam on June 19, 1961

_ intelligence Briefing

Among the interesting items reported in the intelligence
briefing was a response from Embassy Saigon on the Cambodian
border problem,. .Embassy Saigon did not agree with the view of
Embassy Phnom Penh that this is an insignificant problem. At
present, Saigon reports, Cambodia is used primarily-as‘a safe
haven by guerrillas in Viet Nam rather than as an area from
which operations are mounted. The Embassy provided specific’
information on VC activity in Cambodia which, it suggested,
should be shown to Sihanouk. There was also a report that the
Indian member of ‘the ICC ‘has stated in the ICC that that: body
should investigate subversion, This was said to have caused
the Polish member to. ask fora recess of the ICC in order to

- permit him to prepare a-reply. (This report, if confirmed,. is

in line with an earlier TDCS indicating that instructions

-long these” lines had gone” to the Indian’ member of the Ice. ).

It was also reported that on Friday there may have’ peen a
clash between Pathet Lao and South Vietnamese forces just in-
side Laos on the highway connecting Laos -and South Viet Nam.
‘(South Vietnamese forces have been in this area for some time.)

The. following’ table. on operations for May was also presented.’

Thé Local Currency: Costs Problen
Mr. Cottrell reported on the current: status of the-

problem of meeting the local currency sosts of the 20,000 man

increase. A message has beeri sent to aigon requesting the
Embassy to undertake negotiations ‘with=the GVN and offering
three. alternatives in descending, order of preference:

a. The U. s. would commit $5.1 million equivalent . in
piasters, provided the GVN ‘proceeds without. delay, with

mobilization and meets the balance of the local currency
costs’ from its own resources. :

-l-

“Secret



Page 3:
CO! c SRORET “=

“be. If the proposal ‘under a above is not adequate to
obtain GVN agreement, we would offer an additional $4.85
million in piasters. This is estimated to be sufficient
to cover local currency costs in 1961 of the call-up of
the additional 20,000 men.

ce. If neither of the above proposals roves accept-
able, the U.S. would offer an additional $4.55 million in
assistance in 1961 which, if the GVN would accept a dollar/
piaster rate of 73, would be sufficient to meet the ' Plaster
cost for 1961.

‘As of yesterday afternoon,-: no reaction had been obtained

from Saigon. In a long coriversation with Ben Wood, the Deputy
Director of the Task Force, Thuan was told before he left the
U. S..of our offer: under a above. On the basis of this offer,
he indicated that. he would send instructions to Saigon to in- .
itiate the call-up of the 20;000 men, even in the absence of a .
final agreement. This problen,.- therefore, seems on ‘its way
toward solution.

‘

The Situation in Los in Relationship to South Viet Nam

A large part. of: the meeting was devoted to discussion of .

a draft memorandum that Cottrell read to the Task Force con-
taining his ideas with respect to the situation in Laos and
what should be done about it. You are generally familiar with
his ideas as a result of your conversation yesterday with hin,
I did not attempt to take detailed notes on the memorandum, pat
his proposal runs along the following’ lines.

Cottrell does not. believe that any arrangement. to create

‘-a neutral Laos will be viable. He does not believe that we
‘should withdraw in favor of the French in Laos. The French

“cannot be depended upon to do a good job and the reestablishment —

‘of their presence will be deeply resented throughout the former
Indo-Chinese states; The military situation in Laos is alarming.
‘The Pathet Lao are'now posing a serious threat in southern Laos.
-Cottrell. proposes that: we seize upon some plausible excuse to
break off. the Geneva Conference. The failure of the ICC to
stabilize the situation would provide such an éxcuse. He would
then introduce Thai special forces and “hunter-killer" forces
now being trained ‘in South Viet Nam into southern Laos in an _
effort to clean out the Pathet Lao "infection" there. In the
discussion of his proposal, the question was raised as to.
whether the introduction of U. S. forces would not be necessary.
Cottrell acknowledged that this was a real possibility and
emphasized the importance of our not letting our friends in
Southeast Asia down by refusing to use force if that ‘Should
prove necessary,

Page 4:
Co SERED

Members of the Task Force were asked for their .reactions

' to the paper. There was a rather surprising degree of agree-

M.

- agreement in the Task: Force).

: prompted Cottrell to produce his memorandu

ment that something along this line must be done or it will be
virtually impossible to deal with the situation in South Viet
Nam. (There was no State Department representative present at
the time except Cottrell himself.). The ICA member and the
representative of Jack Bell's office did raise questions as to
whether political and economic action by the Diem regime was
not a more important precondition to solution in Viet Nam than

military action in Laos.

I made the following ‘points about. the proposal: First, I
observed. that this would seem to/me to. raise important questions
of policy which had been considered and decided in the past at
the highest levels of government. I. indicated that I would be’
unable to take a personal stand on the issues raised,. I ex-
pressed.:some surprise about ‘the. apparent, unanimity of view that,
unless we undertake military action in Laos, it would be
virtually impossible to deal effectively with the situation in
Viet Nam. I said that, while I could see no objection to the
Viet Nam Task Force raising these questions, it seemed to me
that they. should be raised: much more clearly in the context of
the Viet Nam problem. That is,. the proposed memorandum should
make clear why the present situation in Laos will make it
difficult, if not impossible, to carry out an effective program
against the Viet Cong in Viet. Nam.. Cottrell agreed to take
account of this suggestion (with which there seemed to.be some

oe

‘file feeling: of frustration. which has
_I:specifically
share his doubts with respect to getting the French back into

‘Laos. (I had. thought that this’ proposal -had -been dropped as a°

result of adverse reaction from various sectors. .) > The. Cottrell

' proposals, however, raise. very directly the question of U. S.

military intervention in Laos. It seems to me inconceivable

_that his objective’ could be achieved without such intervention.

The proposals also’ would have the effect, : it sédms ‘to. me,.of -
merging the war in Laos with the war in Viet Nam. I.do not

think that this would be a good: idea..

: I think that. there is a serious question as to whether the
situation in Laos,is not detéeriorating’so ‘wemecweaye that any .
itical solution will meé leave it as a serious source
into: both Viet Nam and Thailand. But I wonder
whether this question cannot be better reviewed in the context
of contingency planning for Laos itself. In-this: connection,

I do feel that the military contingency plan that'we have seen.
for Laos is based upon too narrow a contingency. -- i.°6:, a -
clear failure “to achieve a ceasé fire or the breaking of a
cease fire by the Communists, ‘We need to plan against the

possibility that the Geneva Conference will be. prolonged in-
definitely and that meanwhile the: PL’ will take over Southern
Laos ‘piece by piece and bit.by bit“as it appears to be doing.
I wonder whether you want to check again with Alexis Johnson
on the status of contingency planning? I wonder whether it

isn't about time to have the NSC and the President review the
Laos situation? . .

‘Other Matters

I raised the question as to the next step in consideration
i of Diem's proposal“ for a 100,000 man increase in GVN forces... I
was told that the matter was being studied in Defense. It was
the view of the DoD representative that the possibilityof such
an increase was academic until some time in 1963 because it .
would take until then to raise the 20,000 men already. authorized
and the. 30,000 currently under consideration. (The 30,000 would
be a part of the 100,000 since Diem was using a 170,000 man base.).

‘I also raised the question of whether food supplies were
being cut off by the: Viet Congas suggested._to you by a
‘Vietnamese. I was told that the onl ce of Viet Cong
action in this area-was the recent seizure of seven barges —
carrying sugar. However, it was also stated that the GVN has
given this fear as“an explanation for reduction in rice ex-
ports. That is, the GVN has.withheld rice.from international
markets because of a fear that ‘the rice maybe needed in Viet
Nam-if the:VC. should begin to cut food supply lines, Thus it
may be related to the argument about GVN foreign exchange
mevenuesy eSey ves. mo Rays 4

. There seemed to be no great concern in the: Task. Force
with this as a current'real problem. Following. the meeting I
talked to the ICA representative about whether it would’ be de-
sirable to build up Vietnamese rice stocks to relieve them of
their fear that rice supplies may be cut_off and thus to.per-
mit them to sell more of their rice abroads ‘He indicated that
politically it was'very difficult toijustify export of rice to

_ Viet Nam which was itself a rice exporter. oo

, (Today I talked with Jack King of.CIA.(ONE) about“this
question,. He had not made'a specific study of it, of course,
It was-his impression that, while there was.some VC interference
with rice movements; the problem was not one of ‘independently
serious proportions. That is,.it was a.reflection of the .
general VC problem which was serious, but not in itself a cauze
for alarm, It was also his impression that GVN exports of rice
had been surprisingly well maintained.) - oo

Finally; I raised the question of what planning was . being
done to internationalize the border problem. In response
Cottrell simply referred to his plan for dealing with the.
situation in Laos. .Today I talked with Bob Cleveland in State
about the same points He referred to the arrangements that are
being made for a meeting of MAAG and USOM Chiefs of countries
in the area sometime in July’ at which the border problem,
among others, will be discussed. He also referred to the fact
that Ben Wood is currently working on a counter insurgency plan

_to cover ail of Southeast Asia. Defense had earlier been asked

to prepare such a plan but had failed to do so. (I finda
great inertia, apparently rooted in a basic lack of sympathy,

‘whenever I attempt to raise the question of finding some means

to involve the international comunity in the border question.
Neither Cottrell nor the State Department: representatives..seem
very much. interested; Have you ever discussed this question
with Alexis Johnson? I think it might be useful to do-so.)

Following the meeting I followed up with Cottrell. on the
conversation you had had with him in the morning, asking him
whether he didn't think it would be desirable to send Géneral
Taylor to South Viet Nam-to consider the request for -a 00,000
man increase and also to make surb that our military activities
in South Viet Nam were: sreally being reoriented. He reacted "
negatively . to ithis ‘proposal, taking the view that it was’ un-
desirable to continue sending missions out to inspect the work ~
of ‘people in the field.. In a later conversation with someone
else in State I got a much more favorable reaction to this idea.
The more I think about it the more I am convinced that it would
be highly desirable. I very much share your uneasy feeling about
the situation. : : ,

AND ASSASSINATE AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT LODGE AND OTHER HIGH-RANKING
EMBASSY OFFICIALS AFTER WHICH THE CHANCERY WOULD BE SET AFIRE.
2. ON 8 OCTOBER 1963 BACH SAID THAT EARLIER ON THE SAME DAY
A DELEGATION OF STUDENTS HAD INFORMED HIM THAT THEY WERE ORGANIZING
A DEMONSTRATION WHICH THEY. HOPED WOULD TAKE PLACE IN FRONT OF THE
AMERICAN EMBASSY CHANCERY WITHIN “THE NEXT FEW DAYS" DURING OFFICE °
HOURS AND PROBABLY IN THE MORNING. THE STUDENTS PLANNED TO PRESENT

1. Our reading your thoughtful 2063 leads us to believe a
significant difference of shading may exist on one crucial point (see |
next para) and on one or two lesser matters eagily clarified.

2. We do not accept as a basis for U. S. policy that we have

. no power to delay or discourage a coup. In your paragraph 12 you say

that if you were convinced that the coup was going to fail you would of

course do everything you could to stop it. We believe that on this same

-basis you should take action to persuade coup leaders to stop or delay

any operation which, in your best judgment, does not clearly give

high prospect of success. ‘We have never considered any betrayal

of generals to Diem, and our 79109 ‘explicitly rejected that course. We

generals because of preference for present regime. We recognize heed to

_4 R. We continue to be deeply interested in up-to-the-minute ‘
assessment of prospects and are sending this before reply to our CAS 79126.
we ant continuous exchange latest assessments on this topic.

S.Y% To clarify our intent, paragraph 7 of our 79109 is rescinded
and we restate our desires as follows:

a. While you are in Saigon you will be chief of country

team in al circumstances and our only instruction is that we are
sure it will help to have Harkins fully informed at all stages and to
‘use advice from both him and Smith in framing guidance for coup
contacts and assessment. We continue to be concerned that neither
Conein nor any other reporting source is getting the clarity we would
like with respect to alignment of forces and level of determination
among generals . .

be “When you leave Saigon and before there is a coup, Truehart

will be chief of the country term. Our only modification of

existing procedures is that in this circumstance we wish

all instruction to Conein to be conducted in immediate
consultation with Harkins and Smith so that all three know
what is said to Conein, Any disagreement among the three on
such instructions should be reported to Washington and held
for our re solutionywhen time permits.

ce If you have left anda coup occurs, we believe
that emergency situation requires, pending your return, that
direction of country team be vested in most senior officer with
experience of military decisions, and that officer in our view
is Harkins. We do not repeat not intend that this switch in final
responsibility should be publicized in any way, and Harkins will of
course be guided in basic posture by our instructions, which follow
in paragraph % Thus we do not believe that this switch will have
the effect suggested in your paragraph 8,

6. This paragraph contains our present standing instructions
for U. S. posture in the event of a coup.

a. U. S. authorities will reject appeals for direct
intervention from either side, and U.S, -controlled aircraft and ,
other resources will not be committed between the battle lines
or in support of either side, without authorization from Washington,

b. In event of indecisive contest, U. S, authorities may

in their discretion agree to perform any acts agreeable to both sides,

-FOP-SECRET EYES ONLY 7 -4- 10/30/63
such as removal of key personalities or relay of information, . .
In such actions, however, U. S, authorities will strenuously avoid

appearance of pressure on either side. It is not in the interest

- of USG to be or appear to be either instrument of existing

government or instrument of coup.

c. In thé event. of imminent or actual failure of coup,
U. Ss authorities may afford asylum in their discretion to those
to whom there is any express or implied obligation of this sort.
We believe however that in such a case it would be in our interest
and probably in interest of those seeking asylum that they seek
prote ction of other Embassies in addition to our own, This point
should be made strongly if need arises.

' d, But once a coup under responsible leadership has |

begun, and within these restrictions, it'is.in the interest of the U.S.

~ Government that it should succeed.

7% We have your message about return to Washington and =

GIL prabghicc comment |

enncuneomont-hee-ret-elrenty-beertmmey we suggest that #4 be kept

as low-key and quiet as possible, and we also urge that if possible
you keep open the exact time of your departure. We are strongly
sensitive to great disadvantage of having you out of Saigon if this

should turn out to be a week of decision, and if it can be avoided -

we would prefer not to see you pinned to a fixed hour of departure now,

Current Overall] Evaluation

i The general trend appears slightly ‘fevorable, with the GYN continuing
té"improve its military, and to a limited extent, its political and econs+

‘nic position. Basic problems are -being eroded but quick and decisive
action is rare, There were no major breakthroughs or important victories” .

and noe appear likely in the immediate future, The Viet Cong show no
weakening in strength or determination despite reportedly heavy losses.

On the military side, Operations Binh Minh and Hai Yen continued

well, Viet Cong casualties were up and their activities dom (there is ~
an unconfirmed news report that a major battle took place July 3, however,
in which the VC defeated a regular army battalion}, This may be due to
reorganization and weather rather than GVN successes, The GVN took several
good but minor steps to increase popular support for the war effort, and
several rural e.c%al and economic programs moved ahead significantly. On
the international front, there were some favorable responses to our efforts
to set up an aid coordinating group of donor nations, Economic conditions
improved somewhat, with stable prices, credit a little less tight, consu-
mer goods sales and tax collections up, and rice deliveries contimed good,

Fearing that the prospective law settlement will facilitate Viet Cong
activities and that it may presage a U. S. move to neutralize Viet-Nam it-
self, the GUN has made difficulties at Geneva over several issues and
threatens to boycott the conference. President Kennedy has sent Diem a
personal letter stressing the importance we attach to a Laos settlement
and our determination to continue to help Viet-Nam defend itself. There
is no response as yet.

Progress on Action Program

1, W Activity

Viet Gong activity continued at a relatively low level, with armed
attacks falling to the lowast point over a year, 60, for the period 20-27
Ime and rising only slightly to 75 for the period June 27 - July , The
lack of W aggressiveness is likely due to the rainy season and their
efforts to regroup in order to counter the improved mcbility and perfor-

mance of the GUN forces, Observing that this appears to be a period of

yC reorganization and assimilation of recent infiltrators, COMUSMACV ro-
ports indications that VG units which previously operated as separate
platcons and companies are now being formed into battalions. Infiltration
evidently continues, but good intelligence is scarce, MACV Jo2 estinates
antiltration in May at 800-1,000 and 800 for the first three weeks of June,
but this information is unconfirmed and there are no reports of infiltra-
tion since, ;

' SECRET


Page 4:
SECRET ~
-2-

In spite cf reduced WC activity, VC casualties were high end included
some main force personnel. For the pericd 20-27 June the VC suffered a
reported increace of casualties of almost 25 per cent over the previous |
reporting period. Killed in action for the two week period were 865 VC
end 11 friendiy forces. , ;

Reports continue to indicate a critical VC shortage of madical supplies.
Unconfirmed reports rsiae the possibility thet the VC are attaining an anti-
sirersft capability. |

‘(Pollowiog items are keyed to the Viet-Nam draft action program of
daly 3)

2. Strengthen populsr support. The GUN took several stess to generate
more popular support in the last two weeks. These include the July 7 relesse
of 794 prisoners in connection with the celebration of the "double seven"
holiday (anniversary of Diem's coming to power), a stepped-up drive to root
out low-level corruption and abuse of power by GIN officials, and a Presiden-
tially proposed amendment to the Constitution permitting the questioning of
Cabinet Ministers both by Cosmittees of the National Assembly and by the
Natioval Assembly io plenary session. ‘he prisoners released may include
leading oppositionist Phan Quang Dan, who has been in prison since his par-
ticipation in the attempted 1960 coup, We have urgad the last item on Dies
in the past in an effort to increase the powers and prestige of the National
Assembly. .

Another favorable development is increased emphasis on working with and
for the people in the current training program for strategic hanlet cadres.
Ngo cinh Nhu (President's brother in charge of the stretegic hamlet program)
is concerned that the program win genuine popular support. He favorg the
election of hamlet officials by secret ballot instead ef by customary shaw
‘of harxis. This is now being done in some hamlets.

4, Seek Internztional Support

{s) Cambodian Relations. The GVN replied mildly to the Cambodian
note concerning the ARYN border incursions of June 16, but did not apologize
or offer incemnities. The note ingists that all precautions sere taken to
avoid crossing the poorly marked frontier, admits thst in spite of these pre-
cautions the frontier may have beea violated. points out that any such inad-
vertenit crossing was not motivated by hostility toward Cambodia, denies the

” arrest of or harm to Cambodian inhsbitants, and proposes a mixed border con-

trel committee to study frontier incidents and provide for future border
cooperation.

; Ancther source of GYN-RKG friction, disputed coastal islands.
was the subject of an exchange of notes which threatened to stir up further
trouble between Cambodia and Viet-Nan. :


Page 5:
SECRET

. (b) Third Country Aid. The United States has suggested a
Saigon, and poss: a later” ington meeting of donor country repre-
sentatives to coordinate aid to Viet-Nam. The intention is to stimulate
more third country aid if possible, and to make sure that current third
country contributions are being effectively applied. To date, Australia
aud New Zealand have indicated willingness to participate in such meetings,
Germany will take part in informal Saigon meetings but would not attend
any formal Washington gathering, and the Japanese are "proceeding with
caution" because of the expressed fear that too close identification
with the U.S. will open up Japanese technicians in Viet-Nam to Viet Cong
reprisals. Canada has declined to participate because of its membership
on the ICC. The Belgians. French, Italians and the UK have not yet
responded .

Negotiations for the integration of Australian trainers into
our MAAG appear near completion. The GVN has indicated its willingness to
receive a New Zealand medical team at any time and the details are being
worked out with Wellington and Saigon.

10. Military Civic Action

The 31st Engiceer Battalion assisted the local population at
Cheo Reo in Pleiku Province in the construction of a Buddhist temple.
In addition to the 150,000 copies of a news sheet distributed weekly by
soldiers to the local civilian population, 35,000 copies of the sheet
were also air dropped.

Operations Binh Minh and Hai Yen. Saigon reports both clear-
and-hold operations con’ ng to make progress without serious W reaction.
Increased contact with the VC is reported in the Hai Yen area, however, as
the military move into W territory.

Ay

Hamlet Councils have been elected in the Hai Yen area, but the
Embassy notes a sericus problem in the fact that a hamlet Council member
receives only 300 piasters (about $1.00) per month for what is theoreti-
cally e full time job. In Operation Binh Minh, an effort will be made to
induce the people to move voluntarily into the fourth village to be set
up there. The plan calls for extensive propaganda and explanations in ~
advance of the move. establishment of military control over the area so
that the people will be free to move voluntarily, and up to 15 days to
accomplish the move itself (previous regrouping actions allowed only a a
very short period for the physical move).

Montagnards. Latest information developed as a resuit of jotat
surveys indicates the Montagnard situation is more a long term problem
than an emergency. There has in fact been a movement of some 17,000 Mon-

‘tagnard as a reaction to VC pressures, and this movement will probably

continue, particularly if the GIN provides adequate food and security.
SECRET



Page 6:
SECRET a i
abe’

Almost all Montagnard refugees are at least temporarily resettled and re-
ceiving minimum food, shelter and security.

The Embassy comments that while this information somewhat reduces
the urgency of the problem, it does not change the problem's magnitude or
importance. Difficulties stemaing from the absence of a well directed,
national Montagnard relief program, limited relief resources, and the Viet-
namese prejudice against the Montagnard continue. But the principal and
most encouraging aspect is the fact that the Montagnard have fled the ve
pressures and more may do so.

Strategic Hamlet Program. The second ten day training course for

490 strategic hamlet cadres was inaugurated by Ngo dinh Nhu in Saigon July 2.

Future Plans. According to CAS, General. Dinh's plan for ‘the paci-
fication of Binh Dinh province has been approved by Diem and will soon be
presented to the Hhassy. The First Corps Commander is also reportedly de-
veloping plans for two provinces in his area; these plans are said to stem
from the U.S. interest and support for Hai Yen.

“15. Provide Increased Technical Assistance.

Villege Radios. As of July h, 817 of the plenned 2500 village
radios were ineteTied and operating. Tests of radios for use on trains

were started.

Defoliation. The Embassy has proposed a test of the effectiveness
of defoliaats against YC food patches in the mountainous area of Operation
Hai Yen. Governor Harriman opposes the use of defoliants on food crops be-
cause of the effect on Asian opinion.. Decision and action will be delayed
until the Governor's return fron Geneva,

20. Integrate Economic Measures with Counterinsurgency Effort.

Agricultural Extension. A pilot training program for agricultural
efforts associated with counterinsurgency plans opened July 3 in Qui Nhon.
One hundred farmers will study farming and stock raising nethods for one
month, including the use of fertilizers and pesticides.

Provincial Hospitals. Construction of four of the 25 planned
hospital surgical suites began on schedule.

Anti-Rat progeen. The USOM-supported rat destruction campaign was
carried out in northern provinces June 12-22, resulting in the destruction

of an estimated 15-20 million rats or 20,000 per village.
25. Publicize the Within Viet-Nam and Internationally.

Viet-Nam Photo Service. USIS Saigon ig sending out a weekly packet
of photos designed to enlist third country interest and support for the GW

wer effort. Eight posts have reported favorably on the effort, imticating
no difficulty in placing the photos in leading newspspers.

28. Establish Network of USIS Sub-posts.
The GVN has agreed.to the establishment of virtually eny nander

of USIS sub-posts throughout the country. Negotistions.on locations and
physical arrangements are underway. :

THAILAND

‘Current Situation Evaluation

The RIG has accepted the International Court decision awarding the
disputed Phra Vihern Temple to Cambodia. Thai delegates attended the
Geneva Conference on Laos, which reconvened on Jaly 2, but the RIG has
aot yet announced ite intention to attend the next meeting of the SEATO
Council of Representatives in mid-July.

On July 2 the US begen the redeployment of 1,060 Merines from the
Third Marine Expeditionary Brigade at Udorn. Possible Thai concern over
this move was lessened by our informing them at the same time of a US-
financed program to improve logistic facilities in Thsiland (see below).

On June 29 police arrested one suspected Communist in Chiengrai and
one in Lempang, both in the North of Thailand. The Thai press reports
that subversive documents were confiscated at both locations. According
to unconfirmed reports these documents originated from a Communist pro-
pagenda ring operating out of Northeastern Burma..-

Progress_on Action Pregram

1. Improved Logistic Facilities -

We have outlined to the RIG our proposed progrem to improve
logistic facilities in Thailand. The program would consist mainly of
a POL pipeline to Korat in the northeast, rolling stock, airfield im-
provement, storage areas; and prepositioning of heevy. military: engineer-
ingéequipment. The Thai have agreed to the proposal in principle although
Sarit reserved his decision on our request that the RIG provide the right-
of-way for the pipeline and in-country transportation.

2. Internal Security Plan

We have instructed Embessy Bangkok to cable surmaries of those
portions of the plan which will not have been pouched in time to reach
the Department by July 11. This will permit consideration of the basic
components of the entire plan during Secretary McNamera's forthcoming
trip to Honolulu. :


Page 9:
Current Situation Eval ‘ietoa

The principal remaining issues before the Geneva Conference ’ | including
-SEATO, having. been resolved. it is anticipated that tho new Accords may be
signed next week. There is nevertheless one sericus stumbling block, which
endangers the satisfactory conclusion of the Conference, i.e., the possible
refusal of the GUN to sign. The GYN's position stems from its belief that
so many concessions have been made to the Communists that the security of
SYN is gravely threatened. We are, however, hopeful that Diem will still
be persuaded that we have achieved the best obtainable compromise for Laos
and that we stand firm on our commitments to SYN. ;

Progress on Action Program

There has been little progress on our.action program. We are con-
centrating at present on the following problems:

1. Economic Assistance. Elaboration of our future aid to Laos awaits
the visit of Souvanna Phouma to Washington, tentatively scheduled for
July 25-27. In the meantime, we seek to spread the burden of providing
Souvanna with the material assistance he requires ‘by enlisting contribu-
tions from other Free World nations.

2. RLG Diplomatic Relations. The RLG's decision to recognize 5 bloc
countries and accept an exchange of Ambassadors poses a major problem with
respect to the GUN, GRC, Federel Republic of Germany and the ROK. Further
action by the RLG is deferred until Souvannea's return to Laos. In the in-
terim we are attempting to assist the pro-Western countries involved in
establishing or maintaining satisfactory representation in Laos.

3. ICC. We have asked our Geneva delegation to request the ICC to
prepare a detailed budget and list of equipment needs so that we will be
prepared to meet quickly our share of the requirements. With regard to
the essentisl heavy equipment - helicopters and light aircraft - we are
taking steps to make it immediately available to the ICC.

’ Wy. BAAG Withdrawal. With the signing of the Accords, we will ssek
Canadian Cooperation in utilizing to the full the 75-day period for the
withdrawal of foreign military personnel. This will give us the maxinun
possible opportunity to determine whether the DRV is abiding by its
commitments and vhether the Soviets as Co-Chairman are. carrying out
their undertaking. .

BURMA

Current Situation Evaluation

The internal situation remains unstable. This fact. was highlighted
by incidents on duly 7 and 8 when student demonstrations led by pro-
Communist organizations were ruthlessly repressed by the police and ars.
These incidents could well lead to increased public disaffection with the
Ne Win regime and to a rift between the regime and the opportunistic
leftist groups who have, heretofore, been its only outspoken civilian
political supporters. ;

Interval security conditions are apparently continuing to deteriorate,
though not dramatically. A special Government amnesty offer expired June 30
without producing significant response from the insurgents.

Progress on Action Program
1. Political

It has been confirmed that Brigadier Tin Pe of the Union Révolutionsry
Ceuncil will come to Washington for medical treatment as planned probably
in late July, although precise dates have not been determined.

2. Economic (AID)

No new developments.

a. The Burmese are ready formally to accept. the FY 1962 military
"gales" program. State and DOD have agreed to accelerate deliveries of M2
carbines as requested by the Burmese, to the extent production facilities
permit, in order to contribute to planned post-monsoon counter-insurgency
operations. This action will alsc, hopefully, earn some political credit
for the United States.

b. Embassy Rangoon has confirmed that United States training
for Burmese officers will be continued under the FY 1962 program. 117
prospective students heve been processed for the coming year.

CAMBODIA
Current Situation Evaluation

’ Cambodia's differences with neighboring Thalland and South Viet~Nam
continue, but they have so far not significantly affected the presently
generally ‘satisfactory relations between the United States and Cambodia,

. Thai moves concerning Preah Vihear temple are being watched closely,- and
it appears likely that if the announced decision to. respect the World .

Court's award is. not’ implemented by September the matter may be brought
by Cambodia to the attention of the UNGA. The dispute between Cambodia
and. Viet-Nam over the ownership of. islands off the Cambodian shore has come
to the fore again, with the GVN rejecting a Cambodian protest against Vietna-
mese naval movements near them on the grounds that they belong to Viet-Nam.
Organization of a new Cabinet has been postponed pending religious rites
celebrating the World Court decision.. New evidence of anti-Sihanouk plotting

in Bangkok has developed.

Progress on Action Program

1. RKG-GYN Border Commission (Pol. 8). The GVN reply.to the RKG's proo
test, against. the June 16 border violations is not entirely satisfactory, but
Phnom Penh believes it my allow progress on the border commission proposal
and has raised this possibility with the Foreign Ministry.

2, Force Increase (Mil. 1). The initial reaction of the RKG to approval
of the request for a force increase of 3,18), for MAP support only, is one of
disappointment that military budget support was not included.

3. New Aircraft (Mi1. 5). Four 1-28 aircraft, first increment of six-
teen, have arrived in Cambodia, Formal turnover awaits the srrival of
Ambassador Sprouse. _

ho Repairs (Econ. 9). Invitations to bid have been sent out,
and the ait contact 4s scheduled to be awarded by: August 15. Contractors
would be scheduled to commence work November 1, under the proposed contract.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with the President - 20 February 1964 - Alone

1. Ladvised the President of my willingness to go with him and to meet
early in the day with General Eisenhower if he thought this would be
constructive. He said he felt General Eisenhower might feel he was being
high-pressured and that he intended me rely to advise him of the plan to
surface the OXCART and exchange formalities. He would then tell him hé
was ordering me to go out and brief him in the next week or two and I
should make my own arrangements.

2. Ltold the President we had a very sensitive effective operation
working in Mexico City jointly with Pre sident Mateos which involved
telephone surveillance and was being done in a most careful manner with
\ his knowledge and with the assistance of a few of his trusted officials.
This had resulted in a very intimate relationship between our station chief,
Mr. Win Scott and the President. Ambassador Mann knew of this from
Scott, as did certain selected people in State Department. However
President Mateos did not know of Mann's knowledge of the operation and
looked upon the operation as an intimate arrangement between himself and
the CIA station. I mentioned that Mateos had been best man at Win Scott's
recent wedding. I said the President should not mention this but I wanted
him to know about it if it was raised by President Mateos.

' 3. Ltold President Johnson that we continued our inte rrogation of
Nosenko; our counterintelligence people were inclined to feel he was a
plant but had not made up their minds. President said he thought he was
probably legitimate and would give us some good information. I said I
hoped this was true - that we certainly were taking advantage of everything
that he did give us; that we were working closely with the FBI, however we
could only conclude at the moment that the Soviet's performance and
action were so different from any other defector case that our suspicions
had been aroused. The President asked to be kept informed.

4. The President then raised the question of Spain, suggesting I
might return to Spain to talk again to Franco. He said he was in a very
difficult situation because of announcement of the cut-off of aid to
Britain, Franee and Yugoslavia which he did not know about until he read it
in the paper, and that he was beside himself because he wanted to give aid
of $31 million to Spain but had the greatest difficulty in the justification.

AW shoss Docld: 32283348 Page 2


Page 3:
SEORET-EVES GiLy

I told the President it was my impression from information gained from

clandestine sources that Franco had made some moves to curtail trade
with Cuba after my visit with him but that the Spanish companies were

endeavoring to circumvent his orders by various surreptitious methods.
‘The President asked that I study the matter carefully and speak to him

HW 50955

about it next week.
ACTION: I have asked Mr. O'Ryan to contact Noel

and Iam asking Mr. Ball to contact Ambassador Woodward to
determine whether the Spanish had taken any actions which they

have announced or might communicate to us which would indicate
an intention of their part to curtail or restrict shipping or trade

with Cuba.
5. The President then said he wanted to do everything possible to
get me out of the cloak and dagger business. That he waa tired of
a situation that had been built up that every time my name or CIA's name
was mentioned, it was associated with a dirty trick. He agked if our
economic studies had stood up and I said yes, they had, and that they were
reconfirmed and supported by an exhaustive article in TIME Magazine.

The President seemed pleased at this, expressed satisfaction in CIA's
operations but was most emphatic in his feelings that we should get away

from the cloak and dagger image and expressed a determination to bring
this about by statements he would make from time to time.

DRAFT BRIEFING NOTES 18 February 1963
CUBAN SUBVERSION IN LATIN. AMERICA

I, Introductory Statement

The public pronouncements of Cuban leaders, the

daily record of events in Latin America, and reports

from our intelligence sources within Communist and

other left-extremist elements throughout this hemis—
phere all agree on one salient conclusion: that

Fidel Castro is encouraging and supporting the efforts

of Communists to overthrow and seize control of the.

governments in Latin America,

A. Analysis indicates that the immediate threat
stems less from the subversive efforts of tra-
ditional Communist movements than from Cuban
support of any and all active revolutionary and
terrorist movements.

B. These distinctions are not precise. In some
countries, Castro's original success has spurred
the established Communist movement to action,
and he supports it. In others, the old-time
Communists may even oppose radical action at this
time, and Castro works with more active and more

militant revolutionists.

Cc. In any event, we know of only two coun-
tries--Mexico and Uruguay--where Castro
appears inclined for the time being to
forego inciting violence, and this only
because he wants a favorable climate for
his operations into other countries.

II. Even before the October missile crisis--and
with increasing rancor since then--Cuban leaders
' have been exhorting revolutionary movements to
violence and terrorism, and supporting their
activities,

A. Cuban support takes many different forms.
We have occasional evidence of direct
participation by Cuban nationals, as in
the La Oroya disorders in Peru in December.
We know that some funds move, generally in

’ cash by courier,. from Cuba to the revolu-
tionaries in other countries. While we have

. not been able to come up with the kind of

“airtight proof a court would require that
weapohs move directly from Cuba to these.
same groups, we do know that Cuba furnishes
money to buy weapons, and that some guer-
rilla forces in Peru, for instance, are
equipped with Czech weapons which most

logically would come from Cuba.
-2-
SECRET

DBoclda:32205169 Page 3



Page 4:
. SECRET

B. But by and large, our evidence shows that
Cuba is not now attempting a large program
of physical support for Latin American rev—
olutionaries. It is, rather, concentrating
on supplying the inspiration, the guidance,
the training, and the communications and
technical assistance they require.

Cc. In essence, Castro tells would-be revolu-
tionaries from other Latin American coun-
tries: "Come to Cuba; we will pay your
way, we will train you in underground or-
ganization techniques, in guerrilla warfare,
in sabotage and in terrorism. We will see
to it that you get back to your homeland.
Once you are there, we will keep in touch
with you, give you propaganda support, send
you. propaganda materials for your movement,
training aids to expand your guerrilla forces,
secret communications methods, , and perhaps
funds and specialized demolition equipment."
Castro is not, as far as we know, promising
these other’ Latin Americans any Cuban weapons
or Cuban personnel-~-either leaders, ad—-
visers, or cadres, But he probably does

tell them: "If you succeed in establishing

=3=

SECRET

HW 50955 DoclId:32205169 Page 4



Page 5:
SECRET

something effective by way of a revolu-
tionary movement in your homeland, if your
guerrillas come down out of the hills
and confront regular armed forces, then we
may consider more concrete forms of assist-
ance,"

D. So far, it should be noted, none of the
movements in South America has reached this
final stage--and in fact even Castro's
Sierra Maestra guerrillas never had to fight
a pitched battle with regular military
‘formations which might have required more .

. advanced weapons than small arms, grenades,
mines, and machineguns. In many ways, Cuba
under Castro is the Latin version of the old
Comintern, inciting, abetting, and sustain-

_ing revolution wherever it will flourish.

III, ‘Before going into more detailed evidence of Cuban

“subversion in Latin America, I should note that

Venezuela is apparently number one on Cuba's

priority list for revolution.

A, Fidel Castro said so to the recent meeting
of Communist front organizations for Latin
American women,

1. Che Guevara and Blas Roca both empha-
sized the outlook for revolution .in

Venezuela in speeches in January.

2. One of our established sources of proven
reliability, high in the ranks of the
Venezuelan Communist Party ((a veteran .
party member and leader of the FALN)),

. says the Central Committee agreed in Jan—
uary that a "peaceful solution to the.
present situation in Venezuela is out of

- the question."

B. This same source reported that Communist guer-
villa and terrorist operations in Venezuela
- were placed under a unified command in late

1962, which coordinates activities with the

other militant extremist group in Venezuela, -

the MIR, The result has been the creation of
the FALN, , or Armed Forces of National Liberation,

1. The FALN is currently trying to publicize
its existence by' such acts as the hijack-
ing of the freighter ANZOATEGUI, and by
acts of sabotage and indiscriminate shoot-
ings, These have also been designed to
dissuade President Betancourt from his trip
to Washington.

2. I do not wish to minimize the violence in

Venezuela. The sabotage is the work of

experts, and is being done with advanced
types of explosives. The shooting has
reached the point in Caracas where it is
not safe to go out ‘after ten at night in
some sections of the capital, . But it is
the opinion of both our people and the em-
bassy that this is not a threat to govern-
ment control. It is one thing for a group
of young men to race down a dark street
firing a machinegun from a speeding car,
It is quite a different matter to stand

up to the armed forces, or seize and hold
government buildings.

3. We believe that Cuba has given guerrilla
training to more nationals from Venezuela
than from any other country. I shall ex~
plain in more detail later how we arrive
at our figures on guerrilla trainees. Our
best estimate now is that more than 200

_ Venezuelans received such training in 1962.

ism in the cities, and ‘others were
rounded up and given long prison

One of our best penetrations of the Com-

FUNDING

I. Cuban financing of subversive operations in Latin
America is easy to ascertain and hard to document.
Our evidence shows that it is generally effected
by couriers carrying cash.

A. A Venezuelan politician, Fabricio Ojeda, re-
turned from Cuba in March of 1962, and was seen
by several witnesses to have large quantities
of US currency stuffed in a false-bottomed com-
partment of his suitcase: There is no law
against bringing currency into Venezuela, so
that authorities could not even determine how
much he had brought in. Ojeda later was cap-
tured, tried, and sentenced for guerrilla ac-
tivity.

B. A Nicaraguan exile, Julio Cesar Mayorga Porto-
carrera, was flying from Mexico to Honduras in
September, 1961, when weather forced the plane
to overfly Honduras and land in Nicaragua. He
was found to be carrying $3,600 in cash from
Cuba for Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras.

Cc. Last March Ecuadorean troops raided a guerrilla

training camp in the mountains west of Quito and

arrested some 48 members of the URJE (Union of
Revolutionary Ecuadorean Youth); The leaders ‘of
the group admitted having received guerrilla
training in Cuba, but there was no other evidence
at the time of any Cuban involvement. The URJE,
however, was a Communist-front group whose leaders
had thrown off the discipline of the regular Com-
munist. party, and this January the Communists man-
aged to have a URJE convention, run by Young Com-
munists, expel the leaders. They were accused,
according to published accounts, of having wasted
$44,000 supplied by Cuba for guerrilla activities.
One of our reliable sources in the Communist Party
((a regional Communist leader in contact with the
Cuban chargé in Chile, and a member of the PCE
inquiry commission)) has informed us that the
next-to-last Cuban chargé in Quito blamed the
fiasco on the fact that his successor had passed
the money to the URJE without coordinating with
the regular Communist party.

D. <A highly placed Guatemalan Communist who defected
last November has given us a specific account of
procedures by which Cuba sent cash to Mexico to
buy weapons which were then smuggled into Guate-

mala.

We also have considerable evidence of involved
bank transfers by which Cuban money eventually
reaches Latin American front groups to pay for
political and propaganda activity. In some
countries where the Cubans still have diplomatic
missions, we have obtained photostats showing
that Cuban diplomats paid for printing of front-
group propaganda.
Just last month, one of the first Brazilians to
receive guerrilla warfare training in 1961 was
picked up with a suitcase full of ammunition he
was carrying to some of those same guerrilla
training camps exposed when the Varig plane
crashed in Peru. Interestingly enough, the
Brazilians believe that the money Cuba had been
providing for the camps actually came from Com-
munist China. Since the exposure of the Varig
documents-~and probably since the guerrillas
first reached the Cuban embassy in Rio with
their complaints about mismanagement, confusion,
and corruption--the Cubans have apparently
stopped financing this operation, but the evidence
shows it is still limping along. The man with’
the suitcase full of ammunition said that a woman
attorney in Rio had given him the money to ‘buy a
large hacienda as a new guerrilla camp. We know
=3-

Page 5:

that this woman is a cut-out in the communica-
tions between the pro-Communist Peasant Leagues,
which have run the camps, and the Cuban embassy.
il. The principle that guerrillas must be self-sustain-
ing has obviously been applied to finances as well.

Communists have staged waves of bank robberies in

Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina.

A. The most spectacular hold-up was that of a bank
in a Lima suburb last year which netted almost
$100,000. Some of the participants have been
caught and are being tried in the mass trials
of more than 200 Communists just starting in
Peru. We know that the hold-up was carried out
by a combination of guerrillas and ordinary
criminals, who divided the loot fifty-fifty.
Some of the share of the common criminals has
been recovered, but the Communist half is be-
lieved to have reached the sizeable guerrilla
forces of Hugo Blanco in the Cuzco Valley.

B. Just last week a bank in an outlying Venezuelan
“town was robbed of $25,000 by men wearing FALN
armbands.

Cc. Argentine police last July raided a Buenos Aires
warehouse and found evidence that it had been
the headquarters for a gang of terrorists-—-ap-

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

Subject: Your Meeting with President Lopez Mateos

We do.not expect to make any major political decisions
but want to sive new emphasis to the friendly relations
which exist between Mexico and the United States. These
relations are now at an all-time high. Mexico felt it had
a veal friend in President Kennedy. they. feel the same
relationshi but b sured
warm Texas handshake and abrazo when you greet Lopez Mateos
at Los Angeles would symbolize the continuance of that
relationship,

We want to stress the identity of interests of our
countries and our ability to work out in the “spirit of
El Chamizal" any problems that may arise between us.

Despite the informal. atmosphere of the visit, we
should give serupulous attention to Mexico's extreme

sensitivity on sovereign equality and Mexico's strong
desire to avoid any appearance of subservience to the
United States.

Lopez Mateos speaks for the Mexican Government and
no important decision is made without hie approval. He

has followed an “independent” foreign policy but knows

that good relations with us, especially in the economic -
sphere, are essential to his country. At times his foreign
policy has been too independent-~for example on Cuba and in
commercial and cultural relations with Commmist China.

and geographic position to help control Castro/Communism.

2. Red China

The coming visit of De Gaulle to Mexico and Brazil in
March has prompted speculation that these two countries
are about to recognize Red China. Lopez Mateos has given
us secret assurances, through CLA channels, that he has
no intention of recognizing Red China, We do not desire

to vaise this issue, but if Lopez Mateos ¥aises it, we
should let him know we are aware of his assurances.

3. Mexico's Role in the |

|

Mexico's participation in the Alliance is essential

to its success. Mexico has played a leading role in IA*ECOSOC
and has named the Director General of the Bank of Mexico as

| its representative to CIAP. It has cooperated with us in
providing extensive training facilities for Latin American
technicians, We want to encourage Mexico to make a greater

private enterprise and we also want to encourage Mexico
along this line. We should continue te cooperate with
Mexico in maintaining financial stability and promoting
economie development.

There remain several tracts on the Rio Grande over
which sovereignty is in dispute. We desire to have the
International Boundary and Water Commiésion atudy these
problems and recommend a solution.

Mexico and the United States are cooperating in
eontrolling the importation ef narcotics and dangerous
drugs into the United States. We should strengthen this
éooperation in the mutual interest of both countries. We
hope therefore that Mexico will agree to periodic meetings
of the highest law enforcement officers of the two countries.

An appraisal report by Interior shows that this is
' the most economical way to éupply water to Tijuana. We
are preparéd to go ahéad with a feasibility study if

a. Vietnamese Communist forces
kept up their high post~coup level
of activity over the weekend.

b. The most significant action
was an attack early yesterday morn-
ing against a US special forces train-
ing camp some 30 miles from Saigon.

‘ec. When the smoke cleared after
a sharp fight, four US soldiers were
missing and at least 35 South Vietnamese
were dead.

d. Late yesterday morning, the
Viet Cong shot down two aircraft sup-
porting a government operation in
the extreme south, and damaged twelve
more. Two more Americans are missing
in this action.

e. Back in Saigon, the new re-
gime's troubles with the ambitious
General Ton That Dinh continue.

£. He is still angling to get
control of the important strategic

‘hamlet program and has yet to give

up command of the Third Corps, which
the generals assigned to another of
their number earlier in the month.
This corps is of particular signifi-
cance in that it surrounds Saigon.

Oswald. Press stories to the effect that Lee Harvey
Oswald recently visited Mexico City are true, accord-
ing to our information. Oswald visited both the
Cuban and the Soviet embassies on 28 September. He
was trying, we are told, to arrange for visas so
that he could travel to the USSR via Havana. He
returned to the US on 3 October.

Brazil A new round of military promotions and re-
assignments will be made public today. The present
instability of the Brazilian political scene is re-
flected in the numerous reports of ‘coup plots which
this event has precipitated.

USSR At last report the three Soviet range in-
strumentation ships were dead in the water 500 miles
south of Johnston Island, roughly the same position
they occupied for last year's extended range ICBM
shots. No announcement closing this area of the
Pacific to shipping has been made and there is no
activity as yet at the Tyuratam missile test center,
but we look for some action in the next few days.

Algeria We have a report from a good clandestine
source that a group of army officers is plotting
with Defense Minister Boumedienne to overthrow Ben
Bella. A growing estrangement between the two has
been apparent for some time, but this is the first
good indication that Boumedienne is making common
cause with those who wish to turn Ben Bella out of

Australia - Communist China Peiping has signed con-

expecting the Chinese Communists to enter the market,
since they had another mediocre grain crop this year.
Peiping has been buying close to five million tons

of grain for the past several years.

Congo We hear that the Soviet Embassy in Leopold-
Ville had booked 75 places on a flight to Brussels
last Saturday. There is still no information on
whether any Soviet Embassy officials have actually
departed, however.

Berlin There was no new harassment of Allied ac-
cess routes to Berlin over the weekend. A total of
16 flares were fired last evening near Tempelhof
Airfield, but we connect these with Communist ef-
forts to prevent escapes from East Berlin. East
German police were observed stringing barbed wire
in the same area a short time later.

gains in their limited offensive in the Vang Vieng
area. They have not, however, been able to dislodge
the Pathet Lao from positions within artillery range
of the town's airport. :

1. Iraq-Syria

a. The shaky new accommodation
between the two countries following
the recent coup in Iraq has been
threatened by Syria's action in’ grant-
ing asylum to Ali Saleh Saadi, the
exiled leader of the extremist wing
of the Iraqi Baath.

b. Saadi had arrived in Syria
unannounced following a brief stay
in Madrid, On Friday, Iraq sent a
message asking Syria to expel him on
grounds that sheltering him was a
breach of agreement.

c. Both regimes continue to be
troubled with internal dissension
with affairs in one deeply tangled
with those in the other,

d. In Syria, as we mentioned
yesterday, the Baathist regime is
split. between moderates who desire
a broadening of the government's
power base,and a doctrinaire faction
which wants to keep all control of
the government in Baathist hands.

e. In Iraq, the pull is more
away from the Baathists, Two minis-
ters have threatened to resign unless
the government adopts an openly pro-
Egyptian policy. Nevertheless the
government feels secure enough to
ease up on curfew and transport re-
strictions imposed since the coup.

(Includes INTERCEPTS)

a. Intercepted neutralist mes-
sages on Sunday reported that govern-
ment forces had finally secured Vang
Vieng and its airfield, long held
by the Pathet Lao. They also told
of the capture of Ban Namone farther
south on Route 13. —

b. The neutralist, rightist Lao
Army,.and Meo tribal guerrilla forces
hope to sustain their coordinated
clearing action until remaining Pathet
Lao pockets in this area north of
Vientiane are cleared,

c. Such operations in Laos
have often been followed by a Con-
munist riposte. We have a few in-
dicators that something could be up
on the Communist side, but these are
so far very tenuous indeed.

d. One such indicator is a
stand down in the last two weeks on
the Hanoi-controlled military con-
munications net in Laos which could

Other enemy nets are normal.

e. There are also unconfirmed
reports of North Vietnamese troop

a. According to press reports,
Viet Cong attacks on Sunday wiped
out two of the government's strategic
hamlets in the central highlands about
250 miles north of Saigon.

b. More than 1,000 inhabitants
in the hamlets--who are minority
tribesmen-~are missing and possibly
have fled into the mountains. They
abandoned a significant quantity of
weapons to the Viet Cong.

ce. These attacks not only sug-
gest continued erosion of the govern-
ment's programs to win over tribal
support, but also signal that stepped-
up Viet Cong pressure against the new
regime is spreading to the north.

d.° This Communist effort is
aimed at discrediting the post-Diem
regime before the new leadership is
able to get its feet on the ground
and capture the loyalty and respect
of people in the provinces.

e. Although the Viet Cong still
continues to draw its main strength
from local recruiting, a steady stream
of cadre and training personnel con-
tinues to make its way to the south
from North Vietnam along the Laotian
border.

f. We are now reasonably sure
that at least 784 persons infiltrated
from the north during 1963 and the
actual total may be much higher.

4. USSR a. There have been no further
developments in Soviet preparations
for a series of extended range ICBM
shots to the Pacific.

b. We probably should have had
by now an announcement closing an area
roughly 500 miles south of Johnston
Island to shipping. We suspect the
Soviets may have delayed it in order
not to appear to be rattling rockets
immediately after President Kennedy's
death.

c. The USSR may repeat last
year's performance of multiple fir-
ings from a prototype operational
complex at Tyuratam.,. Three such
launchings were attempted at five-
minute intervals in May 1963; two
succeeded.

ad. We also do not rule out the

possibility of firings from opera-
tional sites as opposed to the test
center at Tyuratam. We observed _
the first such firing on 22 October
from the Plesetsk site, roughly 400
miles northeast of Moscow.

a. Embassy Bonn feels that
the Soviet Union may be seeking at
least a temporary modus vivendi on
the autobahn without prejudicing
its juridical position, which can
be used to cause difficulties there
in the future. :

b. The embassy bases this on
the Soviet replies to the Western
notification to the USSR on 29
October regarding harmonized convoy
procedures--two oral statements on
16 November and a note of 21 Novem-
ber.

Page 11:
ce. The Soviet note was designed
to make a record, showing that the.
USSR exercises "control" of the auto-
bahn and that the recent incidents
resulted from US refusal to comply
with "existing procedures,"

d. On the other hand, the Soviet
procedures described in the oral re-
plies seem to reflect actual Allied
practices, though there is enough
ambiguity to afford the USSR flexi-
bility in any future actions.

6. Brazil a. The danger of an immediate
: coup against the Goulart regime has
receded with the reported decision
of Second Army Commander General
Bevilaqua not to join the coup plot-
ters.

b. Bevilaqua, who has been some-
thing of a storm center, may have
been asked to hand over his command
today as part of a series of reassign-
ments made by President Goulart to
keep the military off balance.

c. On the other side of the
coin, there is widespread belief
that Goulart himself will at some
time resort to a coup to establish
an authoritarian regime.

(Cont 'd)

d. As one éxample Raneiri
Mazzilli, President of the Chamber
of Deputies and next in line for the
presidency, told Ambassador Gordon
on Saturday that he profoundly mis-
trusts Goulart's intentions and in-
tends to maintain the strictest con-
gressional vigilance.

e. Our station in Brazil be-
lieves that Goulart is living in a
dream world. He seems either out
of touch with reality or very poorly
‘informed. Public opinion is not
with him and the tradition that po-
litical power should only be trans-
ferred constitutionally is very
strong in the army, coup reports
notwithstanding.

f£. The biggest danger from
this quarter is that the opposition
may resort to some illegal act, giv-
ing Goulart the excuse to take over,

e. The feelers it put out
after the conclusion of the test-

some of the fraternal parties. They
felt such a meeting could only make
matters worse with the Chinese,

£. Indeed, Peiping saw this
to be Moscow's purpose, and when
the idea failed to take hold,the
Chinese took it to be a setback for
Khrushchev personally.

g. Their reaction to Khrush-

they did not write her script. They
would have said it is the Americans
who are fighting the Vietnamese.

NOTES

South Vietnam Plans are now afoot to shuffle
South Vietnam's Corps commanders so that General .
Khanh, considered by General Harkins to be the best
of the lot, will take over in the crucial delta (IV
Corps) area. General Dinh, the ambitious Minister —
of Security, is still resisting pressure to relin-
quish command of the III Corps area,.and is not in-
- volved in the current shuffle.

Cuba-USSR There are about 8,000 Soviets in Cuba,
3,000 oF these military, according to a bloc offi-
cial in close touch with Soviets in Havana. The
figures are close to our own estimate of 4,000 to
7,000. Some withdrawals continue.

Cambodia-Vietnam Sihanouk seems. to feel that cut-
' ting off his noSe to spite his face was not enough. .
Now he says he will formally recognize North Vietnam
if the US does not silence the Khmer Serei radio.
South Vietnam will cut Cambodia's primary access to
international markets via the Mekong river if he
does. (INTERCEPT)

Indonesia-Cambodia Sukarno apparently plans to go
ambodia on an official visit following his trip
to Manila, The Cambodian ambassador in Djakarta has
advised Phnom Penh that Sukarno plans to leave for
Manila on 6 December and directly from there for
Phnom Penh on the 10th. He will stay three days.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD..

1. After concluding the discussion on Cuba, the Director told the
Board that he wanted to report on the status of OXCART. He noted that we
were on schedule with the aircraft, and that five would be completed by the
end of December. He said that one had reached MACH 2.16 at 60, 000 feet.
Thére had been some trouble with the J-58 engines, but all problems were )
soluble. He said the progress on the aircraft was running ahead of that on
the engines, and noted that we had had 75 hours in the air with 18 hours on
the J-58 engine. He said he had been in direct contact with Mr. Horner to
insure that the project was receiving top priority. Dr. Kilian asked it Pratt
and Whitney had their first team in and the DCI said yes, but one of the
problems was that Hamilton Standard didn't have access to everything in
Pratt and Whitney unless Horner paved the way.

2. Dr. Baker asked if there had been; a solution to the fuel pump
problem and the DCI commented that he believed a solution was being reached.
Dr. Killian noted that Bendix was working on an alternative fuel pump. The -

DCI concluded by saying that while the radar cross section was not as small

4.

as we had hoped for, it was being worked on. — uo

° ’ 3. Mr. McCone then turned to the budget and noted that some
difficulties had arisen in this connection and in the over all field of coordina-
tion: He reminded the Board that they had granted him to review the budgets
of the whole intelligence community, and noted that the military intelligence
budget was 90% of the over all effort. He said that he had discussed this with
Secretary McNamara. Dr.’ Killian reiterated that he thought the DCI should |

review the whole intelligence budget. The DCI noted that intelligence in

_ Defense was going through a transitional period with the development of DIA

and other changes. General Doolittle expressed surprise that CIA was only -
10% of the intelligence budget. The DCI pointed out that Defense was ‘spending

44, 000, 000 on intelligence and CIA only $363,000, 000. This was an.

increase from $2, 350, 000, 000 in the past, but ; efense had put all reconnais-
sance of the Navy and Air Force into its intelligence budget. He said he did
not believe this was correct, ‘and thought it should be deleted.

‘4, . Turning to the CIA budget, the Director said he had instructed the
Agency to keep at the level of last year--this was about:$50; 000,000 less than
what had been asked for by the various departments. He said he thought the |
Agency had worked hard to keep the budget down, and noted that there had to

be additional funds for operations against Cuba. There was an increase in

NPIC, and as a result the budget was $425,000, 000 versus $405, 000, 000.

. The Bureau of the Budget had cut-this to $381, 000, 000 and taken $20, 000, 000

for Cuban operations to charge to the Reserve, The DCI said he found this

unacceptable, and thought the contingency should be pure. At this point

‘Mr. Clifford said he had run across the phrase, MONGOOSE, on several | ,
occasions, and asked what this involved. The DCI then explained briefly the
MONGOOSE project and how it was setup. He said that after his discussion
with the President and Attorney General last fall, it had been decided to
: utilize all resources to unseat Castro, He went on to mention some “of. the
activities of the project. Mr. McCone then said he did not favor continuing
. Sabotage and guerilla operations. He noted ‘that he was very disturbed about
the future and felt that there might be a confrontation within the r next few days,
and that the Russians > might light up the SAM's. He said he had no way of
explaining why the SAM sites were being left there. Dr. ‘Langer asked if it
might not be for fear of an invasion; the Director said he did not think so
because our military forces could eliminate ¢ the SAM sites without r uc
trouble. _ ee | . Se ae

5, Mr. McCone then said he wanted to discuss the NRO agreement.

He said that it had not worked, and the Director of NRO feels that he must

. have fiscal control over CIA projects and review programs progressively
week by week and month by month. ~The per said this was wrong because the
appropriation was to CIA and was approved by a different committee of
Congress. to whom we were re ‘sponsible. He noted that CIA could handle the
project more clandestinely. He had discussed this- matter with the Secretary
of Defense but had reached no agreement, Defense is withholding

$140, 000, 000 and asking CIA to fill out certain forms before they will advance

the money. The Director said that such a.decision cannot be made retro- *
